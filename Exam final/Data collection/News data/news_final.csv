1,2023-07-31T11:30:31+00:00,The 3 Best 3D Printing Stocks to Buy Now: July 2023,"2022 was unkind to growth stocks of all stripes, but the sell-off in the top 3D printing stocks started much earlier. After a strong run-up off the pandemic lows, the 3D Printing ETF (CBOE:PRNT), an equal-weighted index of approximately 50 companies involved in the 3D printing industry, topped out in early 2021 at around $50. Today, it trades for less than half that.

While the ETF is up nearly 19% so far in 2023, slightly outperforming the S&P 500, the performance of individual 3D printing stocks has been mixed. Case in point: Two of today’s 3D printing stocks to buy are up around 40% year to date while one is down about that much.

As an industry, 3D printing is still in the early innings. According to Grand View Research, the market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.3% through 2030.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

As investors look for ways to play burgeoning technologies, money should continue to flow into the top 3D printing stocks. Below are three ways to get in on the action.

Israel-based Nano Dimension (NASDAQ:NNDM) manufactures additive electronics, including the DragonFly IV 3D printer. The volatile penny stock is up 40% on a year-to-date basis following a massive rally over the past few weeks.

The move higher was fueled by the company’s latest quarterly results. For Q1, Nano reported record revenue of $14.97 million, up 24% year over year and 43% from the previous quarter. Further, the company posted a $22 million profit compared with a loss of $33 million in the year-ago quarter.

While Nano’s fundamentals and growth potential are solid, the firm is embroiled in a legal battle with Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) regarding a potential hostile takeover bid. If you can stomach any additional volatility that may cause, NNDM deserves a place among the best 3D printing stocks for investment.

Story continues

FARO Technologies (NASDAQ:FARO) is the underperformer on today’s list of 3D printing stocks to buy. Shares are down 45% so far this year. This includes a sharp sell-off following the release of the company’s first-quarter results in early May.

While sales rose 11% year over year to $85 million, the company reported a much larger-than-expected net loss of $7.1 million compared with a $2.5 million loss in the same quarter one year ago. The company noted that cost increases hurt its gross margin, which fell to 46.7% from 53.5% in the year-ago period.

With inflation abating, FARO should be able to get a handle on its costs. And with the stock trading near a five-year low, investors have a chance to pick up shares at a discount. FARO currently trades at just 0.8 times sales, well below its 10-year median of 2.3.

FARO Technologies has been in business since 1981 and isn’t at risk in any palpable sense. Once it can show that product costs have normalized, the stock could make a quick run higher as it starts to play catch-up with its peers.

Ansys (ANSS)  The logo for Anasys (ANSS) displayed on a laptop screen.

Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS) provides engineering simulation and 3D design software. It is the highest-priced name on today’s list of 3D printing stocks to buy, trading at around $340 per share. It is also the most stable of today’s picks, routinely producing earnings for shareholders.

Ansys’ first-quarter earnings, reported on May 3, were particularly impressive. Revenue jumped 20% from a year ago to $509.4 million. Meanwhile, net income increased by 42% year over year to $100.6 million as the company’s profit margin improve substantially. The strong results gave management the confidence to raise full-year revenue and profit guidance.

The firm is scheduled to release Q2 earnings on Aug. 2. Given that it has beaten analysts’ consensus earnings estimate in each of the past four quarters, another positive surprise may be in store this week. A beat could cause a pop in shares. But if we instead see a post-earnings pullback, investors may want to buy the dip in this top 3D printing stock.

Factors to Note

Higher adoption of ANSYS’ simulation solutions in various verticals, like automotive and ground transportation, aerospace & defense and high tech, is likely to have favored the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.

The company is likely to have benefited from rapid growth in the high-tech industry, led by ongoing development in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Increased demand for high-performance computing and 5G wireless systems in the semiconductor space also bodes well.

Continued momentum in subscription lease licenses is likely to have aided the second-quarter revenue performance, owing to customers shifting from perpetual licenses to subscription leases.

Strong channel distribution, go-to-market momentum and a healthy pipeline are expected to have contributed to the annual contract value.

On the flip side, geopolitical instability, forex volatility and weakness in global macroeconomic conditions are likely to have weighed on the company’s performance as clients cut back on expenditure.

Recent Developments

In June, ANSYS expanded the capabilities of its Ansys Discovery platform by incorporating high-frequency electromagnetics modeling for antennas. This development allows engineering teams to conduct virtual exploration of multiple design areas simultaneously, minimizing the need for costly physical prototyping and testing.

3,2023-07-27T22:30:25+00:00,7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Before the Breakout,"Semiconductor stocks recently received news that bodes poorly for the sector overall: TaiwanSemiconductorManufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is now predicting a 10% sales slowdown in 2023. That figure was pegged at 5% only months ago. Given that TSMC is the foundry to most of the chip industry the slowdown has clear implications across the industry. However, there are still several semiconductor stocks to watch.

Chipmakers in the automotive, cell phone, and industrial sectors are expected to be affected negatively. However, AI chip sales are expected to be the lone bright spot in which growth should continue. The logical conclusion is that AI-oriented chip firms remain investment worthy which is exactly the thesis for the firms in this article on top semiconductor stocks to watch.

Semiconductor Stocks to Watch: ASML (ASML)  a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buy

Source: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.com

ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) has already performed very well this year. The company is the leader in a niche market that includes few competitors at all and none which can match its technological capabilities. The result is that its shares can likely move even higher.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

ASML’s extreme ultraviolet technology is applied to its massive lithography machines used for the manufacture of the world’s most complex chips. No other firms are as capable as ASML in this regard. That means it essentially has a monopoly on the production and sale of these machines that cost hundreds of millions of dollars.

AI chip production is an order of magnitude more difficult which only gives ASML a greater advantage. Its lithography machines are going to continue to be in higher demand as firms look to produce AI chips en masse. That’s part of the reason ASML is confident that sales will increase by 30% in 2023. In turn, that confidence serves as a signal to investors that ASML stock is a buy at this time.

Semiconductor Stocks to Watch: Synopsys (SNPS)  A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneath

Story continues

The current race to design and produce AI chips benefits Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS). The company provides design automation software for the semiconductor industry. Synopsys’ DSO.ai product is an AI integration into the design software that searches for optimization targets in the design phase of chip manufacturing. The appeal of the product is obvious: Firms want optimized chips and Synopsys’ AI-driven software allows that to occur. Synopsys also has AI integrations for the verification and test phases of chip production, VSO.ai, and TSO.ai.

Synopsys saw its revenues increase in the most recent quarter and in the most recent trailing 6 months. However, net income fell slightly as higher costs eroded margins. It hasn’t much-affected share prices at all. Instead, they’ve risen quickly following the release as it exceeded guidance. It remains one of the lesser-discussed chip stocks but one which is very much worth considering for its overall utility within the sector.

Semiconductor Stocks to Watch: Applied Materials (AMAT)  Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks

Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com

Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) provides manufacturing equipment to the chip industry. Share prices for AMAT stock have fallen following the TSMC news, creating an opportunity.

Applied Materials is a more conservative semiconductor investment overall. It includes a dividend with a yield approaching 1%. During the most recent quarter, Applied Materials returned $219 million to shareholders via that dividend. The firm also repurchased an additional $800 million of shares. It’s clear that the company is more focused on shareholders than growth relative to younger chip firms. The point is that AMAT shares offer stability and price appreciation through the growing chip market opportunity.

Revenues increased by 6% while net income increased by 3%. Those metrics suggest Applied Materials is, again, a steady choice for more risk-averse investors. Like every other chip firm, Applied Materials recognizes the transformative power of AI for its business. The firm believes parallel innovation rather than serial innovation is the path forward. That means Applied Materials believes industry cooperation will push forward its progress.

Nvidia (NVDA)  tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocks

As I write this, Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock continues to fall the day after TSMC’s bad news. Meanwhile, the majority of other chip stocks have shown signs of a quick rebound. I think this is an obvious opportunity for Nvidia investors.

TSMC already noted that AI chips are the lone bright spot it sees in terms of revenues in 2023. And Nvidia is the biggest and best AI chipmaker. It’s really a very simple choice to be bullish on NVDA shares right now. Remember, Nvidia expects roughly $11 billion in sales in Q2 which is far greater than the $7 billion Wall Street had previously been expecting. That still remains and Nvidia won’t release those earnings until Aug. 21.

Shares are trading below $450 but analysts believe they could go as high as $767 in the next 12 months. Don’t be surprised if they rise dramatically again. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is set to begin an AI subscription model for 365 Office which should increase revenues. Other firms are going to drive value from AI chips as well and that means Nvidia could see even higher demand soon.

AMD (AMD) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks

AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) offers a lot of potential for investors seeking a true breakout stock. Its breakout potential is all due to its competition with Nvidia in relation to AI chip dominance.

It’s no secret that Nvidia is winning to this point. Its chips are regarded to be the most advanced for AI applications which have caused share prices to skyrocket in 2023. For investors looking for a challenger to that dominant position, AMD is a clear choice. That pursuit could logically see AMD share break out at some point. As a result, purchasing now is probably a smart idea.

That said, let’s analyze AMD in relation to Nvidia and AI. MosaicML compared both firms’ second-best chips and found that AMD chips were roughly 80% as powerful as those from Nvidia. The company believes that further software updates should make the chips equivalent in terms of performance. The company went on to say that AMD excels at software whereas other firms have struggled. Importantly, software is one of the most powerful areas in which improvements to AI chips can be made. That further suggests that AMD is not very far behind Nvidia and that shares could soon benefit.

Marvell Technology (MRVL) A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.

Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.com

Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is a very heavily favored chip stock. The 30 analysts with coverage of the firm are in near unanimous agreement that it is a buy. There’s nearly 10% upside implied by those prices and Marvell Technology pays a dividend so returns could be even higher.

The company provides cloud-optimized chips and is one of the better data infrastructure firms in relation to semiconductors. Marvell Technology helps firms improve their data infrastructure either on-premise or through the cloud.

It is also one of the chip firms that has benefited from AI this year. CEO Matt Murphy earlier stated that AI revenues will accelerate in H2 of this year. The firm’s networking chips are its main AI product and manufacturing is just ramping up. The firm expects AI revenues to double next year after production comes online fully. That should set shares up for a breakout at some point.

Qualcomm (QCOM)  man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% Upside

Source: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.com

In some sense, Qualcomm’s (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock might seem like a chipmaker to avoid on the TSMC news. TSMC was clear that it sees a slowdown in mobile phone chip production but again sees AI chip sales improving.

Qualcomm is a major mobile phone chip provider. It is an integral partner of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in particular. That relationship is set to continue to be strong through 2025 even as Apple begins to transition away from Qualcomm intending to bring production in-house.

iPhone sales aren’t slowing down. That means that Qualcomm should be fine. Its AI mobile phone chips are particularly strong and despite Apple’s desire to move away from Qualcomm, it isn’t that simple. Qualcomm has Apple cornered in that regard and as iPhone sales continue to be strong Qualcomm’s mobile chip sales should remain strong too. That seems to be what the market said the day after the TSMC news as shares rebounded by more than 4%.

These trends bode well for top semiconductor stocks as the number of chips on devices and machines increases.

The iPhone moment of AI has arrived, meaning more chips to train AI models. Every company is considering AI regarding productivity and how it will disrupt their industries. As a result, demand for high-end chips with lots of processing power is growing.

But semiconductor usage is also growing in traditional industries. For instance, the semiconductor content in vehicles is rising. EVs require numerous chips for power electronics, battery management systems, motor control, and charging infrastructure. Moreover, modern infotainment, communication, and user interface features on modern vehicles need more semiconductors.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

With increased applications, semiconductor demand will continue to grow. However, the semiconductor industry is very competitive, with multiple competitors in each segment. Therefore, it’s crucial to pick the winners.

Leading semiconductor stocks with high returns will outperform peers. The following companies dominate their categories and will capture most of the value.

One of the top semiconductor stocks to participate in the AI theme is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Its chips have the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO) and are currently the best in training AI models. These advantages are flowing directly to the company’s financials.

On May 24, the stock reported outstanding first-quarter fiscal 2024 results. Total revenues declined 13% year-over-year, but on a sequential basis, they grew 19% from Q4 FY2023.

The biggest surprise for the markets was their guidance for the second quarter. Management issued second-quarter revenue guidance of $11.00 billion, which was $4 billion above consensus.

Story continues

Management highlighted that we are in the early innings of accelerated computing and generative AI. “A trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure will transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia.

Demand for Nvidia’s products is surging as companies enter the AI race. The firm has had to increase supply to meet the increasing demand. This demand bodes well for Nvidia’s revenue going forward.

So far, its H100 chip is the best in training AI models in the market. Notably, it enjoys a monopoly with very little competition. Although Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) recently launched a potential competitor, Nvidia has a greater than two-year head start. The MI300X is unlikely to challenge the H100’s dominance any time soon.

Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) produces analog chips for various applications. While its chips might not garner the buzz like AI chips, they are crucial in everyday applications. Its chips include data converters, embedded processors, amplifiers, radio frequency (“RF”) technologies and power management products.

The company focuses on high-quality analog chips that enable it to earn higher margins. Since these chips aren’t subject to Moore’s law, they have long product cycles and limited obsolescence risk.

Due to its prudent capital stewardship, Texas Instruments is a top semiconductor stock. Management aligns with shareholders focusing on maximizing free cash flow power share. Since 2004 it has grown the metric at an 11% annual rate.

Currently, the analog chip market is in a downturn, but no company is suited to handle the downturn better than Texas Instruments. While smaller players might struggle, it has a robust balance sheet to navigate the cycle. Furthermore, since its chips have long cycles, the company can build up inventory levels and then fulfill customer orders when the eventual recovery happens.

Taking a longer-term view, the demand for analog chips is growing. McKinsey expects the total automotive sensor market to reach $468 billion by 2030, representing a 5.6% CAGR. Texas Instruments generates 25% of revenues from automotive and is investing to meet this demand. It’s building new fabs to produce analog and embedded processing chips.

For now, TXN stock is one of the top semiconductor stocks to play the digitization and electrification trend. The stock trades at a forward P/E of 24. Additionally, the company pays an attractive 2.6% dividend. With an impressive dividend growth record for 17 consecutive years, expect them to continue flowing.

After the recent earnings-related sell-off, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the top semiconductor stocks to buy on dips. This semiconductor equipment supplier manufactures deep ultraviolet (DUV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines used in chip production.

Today, ASML has a monopoly on EUV lithography machines. This advanced equipment is crucial in making chips, and one machine can cost as much as $200 million. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Samsung, and Intel (NYSE: INTC) are its largest three customers.

Due to its monopoly, ASML enjoys tremendous profitability and is among semiconductor stocks with high returns. Over the past few years, gross margins have improved from 46% in FY2018 to over 50% in the last two years. At the same time, free cash flow per share has grown from $6.64 to $19.30 in FY2022.

Recently, ASML stock sold off after its earnings and disappointing TSMC results. The decline in TSMC’s revenues highlighted the likelihood of a prolonged downturn in the semiconductor equipment market. However, looking closely at ASML’s second quarter 2023 results paint a different picture.

For the quarter, revenues grew sequentially from €6.7 billion to €6.9 billion. In terms of YOY performance, revenue growth was 27.8%. Management also issued an optimistic outlook. “ASML expects strong growth for 2023 with a net sales increase towards 30% and a slight improvement in gross margin, relative to 2022,” said ASML President and CEO Peter Wennink.

Given the company’s dominant position, revenues will increase as accelerated computing and artificial intelligence grow. Buy ASML stock now for growth and returns.

Intel said it earned 13 cents per share on $12.9 billion in revenue for the quarter ending July 1. Analysts expected a loss of 3 cents per share and revenue of just $12.1 billion. Revenue was down 15% and earnings were down 54% from a year ago. The company estimated third-quarter earnings at 20 cents per share.

Before earnings, traders didn’t know how the results would shake out. Bears saw AI draining revenue from the former “Chipzilla.” Most investment analysts were on the sidelines. Shares jumped $2 in the aftermarket, to about $36.40.

But that’s not the point, my friend.

The Foundry Business

Intel is really two businesses. The foundry business is in the process of being reborn, helped by subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act meant to “re-home” supply chains from China. Intel will be losing billions of dollars on this business until its Ohio plants come up to speed. Once they do, it will impact the industry far beyond Intel.

Big bucks are pouring into Intel Foundry Services. Start with $20 billion for new foundries in Ohio but don’t stop there. There is also up to $36 billion going into new European foundries. There’s Intel’s entry into analog chips by buyingTower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM). There are a growing number of foundry partnerships. Intel is taking the whole semiconductor industry along for this ride.

If you believe in a new “AI SuperCycle” in companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), then you expect these investments to pay off in time. If you’re looking to see why the U.S. economy refuses to roll over despite constant interest rate hikes, investments like Intel’s are a big part of the reason.

Story continues

Are there risks? You bet. Intel must perfect the EUV technology pioneered by Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) (known in the trade as TSMC) and powered by equipment from ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) in Europe. It must hire and train a huge new workforce, amidst faltering demographics and a stressed U.S. education system. Demand for these new products must hold up.

But I believe in America. I believe this will work.

The Software Business

While Intel was dithering over the last two decades, with marketing-based committees running the show instead of process engineers, hardware became software.

Nvidia and AMD don’t make chips. They create designs in software that fabricators like TSMC and, in time, Intel, turn into silicon.

The software side of Intel is second-rate. The cracks were papered over in the last decade by the cloud, which needed the cheapest central processing unit (CPU) chips, in quantity, to build hyperscale data centers. Its fall has come about because clouds are being upgraded with the fastest possible graphics processing unit (GPU) chips. Intel has been left behind.

It will take years to fix this, and it may never be fixed. Intel may remain a laggard in GPUs and could keep losing share in CPUs to AMD. That’s why Intel is putting investment elsewhere, into foundries and analog chips.

The Bottom Line on INTC Stock

Our Louis Navellier is right. Intel is not the best play for AI.

The best plays are in the application space, in software that can provide productivity gains when the Internet’s full database capability is applied to it. Software-as-a-Service companies like ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are going to take the lead.

But Intel may be the most essential play for AI. It may already be the second-largest chip foundry. In a few years it’s going to be the largest one. A lot of upcoming Nvidia and AMD chips will be made by Intel. They need to be made there, to fulfill their own promises.

This is why I’m keeping money in Intel stock. It’s not about this quarter’s earnings, as nice as they look, and barely about next year. It’s about the rest of the decade — and America’s place in the new economy.

9,2023-07-31T19:52:35+00:00,7 Stocks to Buy Before They Surpass 2021 Highs,"The stock market has rebounded in 2023 following a year marked by rate hikes that pulled everything much lower. Leading indexes fell dramatically with the S&P 500 shedding 18.25% of its value. Hikes pounded the tech-heavy Nasdaq which fell by more than 30% during the same period. The emergence of AI, along with slowing rate hikes, has catalyzed a rebound in the markets in 2023. However, major indexes haven’t reached their 2021 highs. With inflation falling and rate hikes nearly over there’s reason to believe that the markets- and stocks could surge past their high marks in 2021. Let’s dive into a few of the top stocks to watch before new peaks.

Stocks to Watch Before New Peaks: AMD (AMD) man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% Upside

I’ve been saying the same thing about AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) stock for the past few weeks. If you’ve read my articles during that period, this will be a bit repetitive. That said, it remains true and serves as a logical basis for prices to move upward: AMD is not that far behind its main rival, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).

The reason to believe that this is true lies in research recently released by MosaicML, a machine learning firm that was recently acquired by Databricks. MosaicML undertook extensive testing of the second-most powerful chips from AMD and Nvidia in relation to their AI prowess.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The result was particularly inspiring for AMD champions: Its chips are nearly as fast as those from Nvidia. Further, AMD’s relative strengths in software development are particularly relevant to AI. The software has been identified as an area from which rapid AI improvements will emerge. It all points to the idea that AMD could run much higher. AMD hit $154 in 2021 and currently stands at $111.

Stocks to Watch Before New Peaks: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""

Source: PX Media / Shutterstock

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock traded roughly $5 higher at its 2021 peak from its current price. You may be tempted to believe that those higher prices are logical given that it was one of the major firms to produce a Covid-19 vaccine. The logic is that revenues spiked on its approval and that Johnson & Johnson lacks a similar catalyst at the moment.

Story continues

While it’s true that there is no similar catalyst for the firm at the moment, there’s a simple reason to believe in JNJ shares. Johnson & Johnson’s revenues reached $94.94 billion in 2021. In 2023, they’re expected to eclipse $100 billion. Is that astronomical growth by any stretch of the imagination? No, not all. However, it does prove that JNJ is bigger than it was even when it had a Covid-19 vaccine. The other vaccine winners, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) will have far smaller revenue bases in 2023 than each did in 2021, respectively.

JNJ is the most stable of the bunch. Its revenues will be greater in 2023 than in 2021. Thus, its price-to-sales ratio is more attractive at the moment. Add in JNJ’s dividend and the choice gets even easier.

Stocks to Watch Before New Peaks: Coca-Cola (KO) Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker cryptos

Source: Epic Cure / Shutterstock

Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) shares traded for $60 at their peak in 2021. KO stock currently trades for $62.50 so it has actually surpassed its 2021 highs. Nevertheless, it remains worth considering at this point.

The firm released second-quarter earnings on July 26 which were very strong. Those earnings showed that sales remain very strong, growing at 6% with organic revenue growing at 11%.

That allowed management to raise its full-year forecast for organic revenue growth to between 8-9% from a previous 7-8% in 2023. The results come as Coca-Cola has raised prices even as consumers are already dealing with inflation that erodes their purchasing power. It indicates that demand remains very strong overall.

It’s difficult to find much fault in Coca-Cola’s execution and results even if you feel they could have given consumers a break in pricing. Shareholders are certainly happy. EPS increased by 34%, reaching $0.59. KO stock’s dividend is a bonus and yields nearly 3% currently.

Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) currently makes a lot of sense as a stock investment. The search giant just released second-quarter earnings that were much better than expected and should galvanize a period in which share prices rise.

Revenues for the quarter reached $74.6 billion, ahead of the $72.9 billion Wall Street had been expecting. That earnings beat will be consequential for investors over the coming weeks and months. The beat led to strong income growth of 14.79%(1) which was another bright spot for the firm.

Revenue growth reached 7% on a year-over-year basis down from 13% a year earlier. Slowing growth rates should matter but I’d argue they’re less of a concern due to the overall trajectory. Alphabet is expecting more than $300 billion in sales this year which is a turnaround from the $283 billion in 2022. Search, advertising, Cloud, and other bets are all growing and as rate hikes stop GOOG stock is in a strong position overall relative to its 2021 peak prices.

Meta Platforms (META)  hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks

Investors should consider riding the upward momentum in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock. The fundamental case underpinning that idea is very solid. That’s where we’ll start.

Here’s what I particularly like about META shares currently: Even though the firm’s revenues grew in both the last 3 months and the last 6 months, net income did not. It decreased on a year-over-year basis during the most recent 6 months. However, it increased on a year-over-year basis during the latest 3-month period on a year-over-year basis. That suggests that Meta Platforms is doing much better now and that a real turnaround is in effect.

That’s true despite the fact that Reality Labs’ losses are getting bigger. Ad revenues and its Facebook and Instagram apps have rebounded. That’s very important to the overall narrative for Meta. The economy looks to have dodged the worst outcomes of rate hikes at this point. That should inspire businesses to spend more on ad revenue and continue to bolster META shares in the process.

Albemarle (ALB)  tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocks

Source: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.com

Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) has emerged as one of the more important EV stocks over the past few years. Its position is secured in the sector. Lithium demand is expected to grow. Those factors are powerful and have led Albemarle to make bold projections that should have investor interest piqued.

Before I get into that, let me quickly note how rapidly Albemarle is growing. In Q1, revenues grew by 129% reaching $2.6 billion while net income rose by 389%. Even though prices were not stable those results proved that lithium demand is massive on EV sales that aren’t weakening.

Let’s get back to those projections. Albemarle increased its 2030 lithium demand forecast by 15% over its previous expectations early this year. The company anticipates increasing demand through 2030 paired with a supply shortfall. The economic takeaway is clear: Prices are going to rise over the long term. Current prices make for a good entry point.

Microsoft (MSFT)  Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares recently tested new all-time highs of $350 before quickly falling to $330. I think the market has got it wrong: MSFT stock is worth $350 per share. The decline is an opportunity.

The reason to believe so is simple: Microsoft traded at $330 in 2021, a year in which the company reported $168 in sales. It could eclipse $240 billion in sales this year. Thus, its price-to-sales ratio clearly favors the notion that share prices could burst above $350 moving forward.

Why shouldn’t investors believe that idea? After all, Microsoft has made massive strides in AI. It is finding new revenue streams therein. Office 365 AI integrations are the latest news on that front. Time will tell how that goes. In any case, Microsoft is now a better firm than it was back in 2021 when it traded at a similar price. It’s a very simple, logical argument, and simple, logical arguments are often very powerful.
