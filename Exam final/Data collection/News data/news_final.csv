1,2023-07-31T11:30:31+00:00,The 3 Best 3D Printing Stocks to Buy Now: July 2023,"2022 was unkind to growth stocks of all stripes, but the sell-off in the top 3D printing stocks started much earlier. After a strong run-up off the pandemic lows, the 3D Printing ETF (CBOE:PRNT), an equal-weighted index of approximately 50 companies involved in the 3D printing industry, topped out in early 2021 at around $50. Today, it trades for less than half that.

While the ETF is up nearly 19% so far in 2023, slightly outperforming the S&P 500, the performance of individual 3D printing stocks has been mixed. Case in point: Two of today’s 3D printing stocks to buy are up around 40% year to date while one is down about that much.

As an industry, 3D printing is still in the early innings. According to Grand View Research, the market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.3% through 2030.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

As investors look for ways to play burgeoning technologies, money should continue to flow into the top 3D printing stocks. Below are three ways to get in on the action.

Israel-based Nano Dimension (NASDAQ:NNDM) manufactures additive electronics, including the DragonFly IV 3D printer. The volatile penny stock is up 40% on a year-to-date basis following a massive rally over the past few weeks.

The move higher was fueled by the company’s latest quarterly results. For Q1, Nano reported record revenue of $14.97 million, up 24% year over year and 43% from the previous quarter. Further, the company posted a $22 million profit compared with a loss of $33 million in the year-ago quarter.

While Nano’s fundamentals and growth potential are solid, the firm is embroiled in a legal battle with Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) regarding a potential hostile takeover bid. If you can stomach any additional volatility that may cause, NNDM deserves a place among the best 3D printing stocks for investment.

Story continues

FARO Technologies (NASDAQ:FARO) is the underperformer on today’s list of 3D printing stocks to buy. Shares are down 45% so far this year. This includes a sharp sell-off following the release of the company’s first-quarter results in early May.

While sales rose 11% year over year to $85 million, the company reported a much larger-than-expected net loss of $7.1 million compared with a $2.5 million loss in the same quarter one year ago. The company noted that cost increases hurt its gross margin, which fell to 46.7% from 53.5% in the year-ago period.

With inflation abating, FARO should be able to get a handle on its costs. And with the stock trading near a five-year low, investors have a chance to pick up shares at a discount. FARO currently trades at just 0.8 times sales, well below its 10-year median of 2.3.

FARO Technologies has been in business since 1981 and isn’t at risk in any palpable sense. Once it can show that product costs have normalized, the stock could make a quick run higher as it starts to play catch-up with its peers.

Ansys (ANSS)  The logo for Anasys (ANSS) displayed on a laptop screen.

Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS) provides engineering simulation and 3D design software. It is the highest-priced name on today’s list of 3D printing stocks to buy, trading at around $340 per share. It is also the most stable of today’s picks, routinely producing earnings for shareholders.

Ansys’ first-quarter earnings, reported on May 3, were particularly impressive. Revenue jumped 20% from a year ago to $509.4 million. Meanwhile, net income increased by 42% year over year to $100.6 million as the company’s profit margin improve substantially. The strong results gave management the confidence to raise full-year revenue and profit guidance.

The firm is scheduled to release Q2 earnings on Aug. 2. Given that it has beaten analysts’ consensus earnings estimate in each of the past four quarters, another positive surprise may be in store this week. A beat could cause a pop in shares. But if we instead see a post-earnings pullback, investors may want to buy the dip in this top 3D printing stock.

Factors to Note

Higher adoption of ANSYS’ simulation solutions in various verticals, like automotive and ground transportation, aerospace & defense and high tech, is likely to have favored the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.

The company is likely to have benefited from rapid growth in the high-tech industry, led by ongoing development in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Increased demand for high-performance computing and 5G wireless systems in the semiconductor space also bodes well.

Continued momentum in subscription lease licenses is likely to have aided the second-quarter revenue performance, owing to customers shifting from perpetual licenses to subscription leases.

Strong channel distribution, go-to-market momentum and a healthy pipeline are expected to have contributed to the annual contract value.

On the flip side, geopolitical instability, forex volatility and weakness in global macroeconomic conditions are likely to have weighed on the company’s performance as clients cut back on expenditure.

Recent Developments

In June, ANSYS expanded the capabilities of its Ansys Discovery platform by incorporating high-frequency electromagnetics modeling for antennas. This development allows engineering teams to conduct virtual exploration of multiple design areas simultaneously, minimizing the need for costly physical prototyping and testing.

3,2023-07-27T22:30:25+00:00,7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Before the Breakout,"Semiconductor stocks recently received news that bodes poorly for the sector overall: TaiwanSemiconductorManufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is now predicting a 10% sales slowdown in 2023. That figure was pegged at 5% only months ago. Given that TSMC is the foundry to most of the chip industry the slowdown has clear implications across the industry. However, there are still several semiconductor stocks to watch.

Chipmakers in the automotive, cell phone, and industrial sectors are expected to be affected negatively. However, AI chip sales are expected to be the lone bright spot in which growth should continue. The logical conclusion is that AI-oriented chip firms remain investment worthy which is exactly the thesis for the firms in this article on top semiconductor stocks to watch.

Semiconductor Stocks to Watch: ASML (ASML)  a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buy

Source: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.com

ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) has already performed very well this year. The company is the leader in a niche market that includes few competitors at all and none which can match its technological capabilities. The result is that its shares can likely move even higher.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

ASML’s extreme ultraviolet technology is applied to its massive lithography machines used for the manufacture of the world’s most complex chips. No other firms are as capable as ASML in this regard. That means it essentially has a monopoly on the production and sale of these machines that cost hundreds of millions of dollars.

AI chip production is an order of magnitude more difficult which only gives ASML a greater advantage. Its lithography machines are going to continue to be in higher demand as firms look to produce AI chips en masse. That’s part of the reason ASML is confident that sales will increase by 30% in 2023. In turn, that confidence serves as a signal to investors that ASML stock is a buy at this time.

Semiconductor Stocks to Watch: Synopsys (SNPS)  A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneath

Story continues

The current race to design and produce AI chips benefits Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS). The company provides design automation software for the semiconductor industry. Synopsys’ DSO.ai product is an AI integration into the design software that searches for optimization targets in the design phase of chip manufacturing. The appeal of the product is obvious: Firms want optimized chips and Synopsys’ AI-driven software allows that to occur. Synopsys also has AI integrations for the verification and test phases of chip production, VSO.ai, and TSO.ai.

Synopsys saw its revenues increase in the most recent quarter and in the most recent trailing 6 months. However, net income fell slightly as higher costs eroded margins. It hasn’t much-affected share prices at all. Instead, they’ve risen quickly following the release as it exceeded guidance. It remains one of the lesser-discussed chip stocks but one which is very much worth considering for its overall utility within the sector.

Semiconductor Stocks to Watch: Applied Materials (AMAT)  Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks

Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com

Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) provides manufacturing equipment to the chip industry. Share prices for AMAT stock have fallen following the TSMC news, creating an opportunity.

Applied Materials is a more conservative semiconductor investment overall. It includes a dividend with a yield approaching 1%. During the most recent quarter, Applied Materials returned $219 million to shareholders via that dividend. The firm also repurchased an additional $800 million of shares. It’s clear that the company is more focused on shareholders than growth relative to younger chip firms. The point is that AMAT shares offer stability and price appreciation through the growing chip market opportunity.

Revenues increased by 6% while net income increased by 3%. Those metrics suggest Applied Materials is, again, a steady choice for more risk-averse investors. Like every other chip firm, Applied Materials recognizes the transformative power of AI for its business. The firm believes parallel innovation rather than serial innovation is the path forward. That means Applied Materials believes industry cooperation will push forward its progress.

Nvidia (NVDA)  tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocks

As I write this, Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock continues to fall the day after TSMC’s bad news. Meanwhile, the majority of other chip stocks have shown signs of a quick rebound. I think this is an obvious opportunity for Nvidia investors.

TSMC already noted that AI chips are the lone bright spot it sees in terms of revenues in 2023. And Nvidia is the biggest and best AI chipmaker. It’s really a very simple choice to be bullish on NVDA shares right now. Remember, Nvidia expects roughly $11 billion in sales in Q2 which is far greater than the $7 billion Wall Street had previously been expecting. That still remains and Nvidia won’t release those earnings until Aug. 21.

Shares are trading below $450 but analysts believe they could go as high as $767 in the next 12 months. Don’t be surprised if they rise dramatically again. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is set to begin an AI subscription model for 365 Office which should increase revenues. Other firms are going to drive value from AI chips as well and that means Nvidia could see even higher demand soon.

AMD (AMD) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks

AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) offers a lot of potential for investors seeking a true breakout stock. Its breakout potential is all due to its competition with Nvidia in relation to AI chip dominance.

It’s no secret that Nvidia is winning to this point. Its chips are regarded to be the most advanced for AI applications which have caused share prices to skyrocket in 2023. For investors looking for a challenger to that dominant position, AMD is a clear choice. That pursuit could logically see AMD share break out at some point. As a result, purchasing now is probably a smart idea.

That said, let’s analyze AMD in relation to Nvidia and AI. MosaicML compared both firms’ second-best chips and found that AMD chips were roughly 80% as powerful as those from Nvidia. The company believes that further software updates should make the chips equivalent in terms of performance. The company went on to say that AMD excels at software whereas other firms have struggled. Importantly, software is one of the most powerful areas in which improvements to AI chips can be made. That further suggests that AMD is not very far behind Nvidia and that shares could soon benefit.

Marvell Technology (MRVL) A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.

Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.com

Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is a very heavily favored chip stock. The 30 analysts with coverage of the firm are in near unanimous agreement that it is a buy. There’s nearly 10% upside implied by those prices and Marvell Technology pays a dividend so returns could be even higher.

The company provides cloud-optimized chips and is one of the better data infrastructure firms in relation to semiconductors. Marvell Technology helps firms improve their data infrastructure either on-premise or through the cloud.

It is also one of the chip firms that has benefited from AI this year. CEO Matt Murphy earlier stated that AI revenues will accelerate in H2 of this year. The firm’s networking chips are its main AI product and manufacturing is just ramping up. The firm expects AI revenues to double next year after production comes online fully. That should set shares up for a breakout at some point.

Qualcomm (QCOM)  man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% Upside

Source: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.com

In some sense, Qualcomm’s (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock might seem like a chipmaker to avoid on the TSMC news. TSMC was clear that it sees a slowdown in mobile phone chip production but again sees AI chip sales improving.

Qualcomm is a major mobile phone chip provider. It is an integral partner of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in particular. That relationship is set to continue to be strong through 2025 even as Apple begins to transition away from Qualcomm intending to bring production in-house.

iPhone sales aren’t slowing down. That means that Qualcomm should be fine. Its AI mobile phone chips are particularly strong and despite Apple’s desire to move away from Qualcomm, it isn’t that simple. Qualcomm has Apple cornered in that regard and as iPhone sales continue to be strong Qualcomm’s mobile chip sales should remain strong too. That seems to be what the market said the day after the TSMC news as shares rebounded by more than 4%.

These trends bode well for top semiconductor stocks as the number of chips on devices and machines increases.

The iPhone moment of AI has arrived, meaning more chips to train AI models. Every company is considering AI regarding productivity and how it will disrupt their industries. As a result, demand for high-end chips with lots of processing power is growing.

But semiconductor usage is also growing in traditional industries. For instance, the semiconductor content in vehicles is rising. EVs require numerous chips for power electronics, battery management systems, motor control, and charging infrastructure. Moreover, modern infotainment, communication, and user interface features on modern vehicles need more semiconductors.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

With increased applications, semiconductor demand will continue to grow. However, the semiconductor industry is very competitive, with multiple competitors in each segment. Therefore, it’s crucial to pick the winners.

Leading semiconductor stocks with high returns will outperform peers. The following companies dominate their categories and will capture most of the value.

One of the top semiconductor stocks to participate in the AI theme is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Its chips have the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO) and are currently the best in training AI models. These advantages are flowing directly to the company’s financials.

On May 24, the stock reported outstanding first-quarter fiscal 2024 results. Total revenues declined 13% year-over-year, but on a sequential basis, they grew 19% from Q4 FY2023.

The biggest surprise for the markets was their guidance for the second quarter. Management issued second-quarter revenue guidance of $11.00 billion, which was $4 billion above consensus.

Story continues

Management highlighted that we are in the early innings of accelerated computing and generative AI. “A trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure will transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia.

Demand for Nvidia’s products is surging as companies enter the AI race. The firm has had to increase supply to meet the increasing demand. This demand bodes well for Nvidia’s revenue going forward.

So far, its H100 chip is the best in training AI models in the market. Notably, it enjoys a monopoly with very little competition. Although Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) recently launched a potential competitor, Nvidia has a greater than two-year head start. The MI300X is unlikely to challenge the H100’s dominance any time soon.

Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) produces analog chips for various applications. While its chips might not garner the buzz like AI chips, they are crucial in everyday applications. Its chips include data converters, embedded processors, amplifiers, radio frequency (“RF”) technologies and power management products.

The company focuses on high-quality analog chips that enable it to earn higher margins. Since these chips aren’t subject to Moore’s law, they have long product cycles and limited obsolescence risk.

Due to its prudent capital stewardship, Texas Instruments is a top semiconductor stock. Management aligns with shareholders focusing on maximizing free cash flow power share. Since 2004 it has grown the metric at an 11% annual rate.

Currently, the analog chip market is in a downturn, but no company is suited to handle the downturn better than Texas Instruments. While smaller players might struggle, it has a robust balance sheet to navigate the cycle. Furthermore, since its chips have long cycles, the company can build up inventory levels and then fulfill customer orders when the eventual recovery happens.

Taking a longer-term view, the demand for analog chips is growing. McKinsey expects the total automotive sensor market to reach $468 billion by 2030, representing a 5.6% CAGR. Texas Instruments generates 25% of revenues from automotive and is investing to meet this demand. It’s building new fabs to produce analog and embedded processing chips.

For now, TXN stock is one of the top semiconductor stocks to play the digitization and electrification trend. The stock trades at a forward P/E of 24. Additionally, the company pays an attractive 2.6% dividend. With an impressive dividend growth record for 17 consecutive years, expect them to continue flowing.

After the recent earnings-related sell-off, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the top semiconductor stocks to buy on dips. This semiconductor equipment supplier manufactures deep ultraviolet (DUV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines used in chip production.

Today, ASML has a monopoly on EUV lithography machines. This advanced equipment is crucial in making chips, and one machine can cost as much as $200 million. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Samsung, and Intel (NYSE: INTC) are its largest three customers.

Due to its monopoly, ASML enjoys tremendous profitability and is among semiconductor stocks with high returns. Over the past few years, gross margins have improved from 46% in FY2018 to over 50% in the last two years. At the same time, free cash flow per share has grown from $6.64 to $19.30 in FY2022.

Recently, ASML stock sold off after its earnings and disappointing TSMC results. The decline in TSMC’s revenues highlighted the likelihood of a prolonged downturn in the semiconductor equipment market. However, looking closely at ASML’s second quarter 2023 results paint a different picture.

For the quarter, revenues grew sequentially from €6.7 billion to €6.9 billion. In terms of YOY performance, revenue growth was 27.8%. Management also issued an optimistic outlook. “ASML expects strong growth for 2023 with a net sales increase towards 30% and a slight improvement in gross margin, relative to 2022,” said ASML President and CEO Peter Wennink.

Given the company’s dominant position, revenues will increase as accelerated computing and artificial intelligence grow. Buy ASML stock now for growth and returns.

Intel said it earned 13 cents per share on $12.9 billion in revenue for the quarter ending July 1. Analysts expected a loss of 3 cents per share and revenue of just $12.1 billion. Revenue was down 15% and earnings were down 54% from a year ago. The company estimated third-quarter earnings at 20 cents per share.

Before earnings, traders didn’t know how the results would shake out. Bears saw AI draining revenue from the former “Chipzilla.” Most investment analysts were on the sidelines. Shares jumped $2 in the aftermarket, to about $36.40.

But that’s not the point, my friend.

The Foundry Business

Intel is really two businesses. The foundry business is in the process of being reborn, helped by subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act meant to “re-home” supply chains from China. Intel will be losing billions of dollars on this business until its Ohio plants come up to speed. Once they do, it will impact the industry far beyond Intel.

Big bucks are pouring into Intel Foundry Services. Start with $20 billion for new foundries in Ohio but don’t stop there. There is also up to $36 billion going into new European foundries. There’s Intel’s entry into analog chips by buyingTower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM). There are a growing number of foundry partnerships. Intel is taking the whole semiconductor industry along for this ride.

If you believe in a new “AI SuperCycle” in companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), then you expect these investments to pay off in time. If you’re looking to see why the U.S. economy refuses to roll over despite constant interest rate hikes, investments like Intel’s are a big part of the reason.

Story continues

Are there risks? You bet. Intel must perfect the EUV technology pioneered by Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) (known in the trade as TSMC) and powered by equipment from ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) in Europe. It must hire and train a huge new workforce, amidst faltering demographics and a stressed U.S. education system. Demand for these new products must hold up.

But I believe in America. I believe this will work.

The Software Business

While Intel was dithering over the last two decades, with marketing-based committees running the show instead of process engineers, hardware became software.

Nvidia and AMD don’t make chips. They create designs in software that fabricators like TSMC and, in time, Intel, turn into silicon.

The software side of Intel is second-rate. The cracks were papered over in the last decade by the cloud, which needed the cheapest central processing unit (CPU) chips, in quantity, to build hyperscale data centers. Its fall has come about because clouds are being upgraded with the fastest possible graphics processing unit (GPU) chips. Intel has been left behind.

It will take years to fix this, and it may never be fixed. Intel may remain a laggard in GPUs and could keep losing share in CPUs to AMD. That’s why Intel is putting investment elsewhere, into foundries and analog chips.

The Bottom Line on INTC Stock

Our Louis Navellier is right. Intel is not the best play for AI.

The best plays are in the application space, in software that can provide productivity gains when the Internet’s full database capability is applied to it. Software-as-a-Service companies like ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are going to take the lead.

But Intel may be the most essential play for AI. It may already be the second-largest chip foundry. In a few years it’s going to be the largest one. A lot of upcoming Nvidia and AMD chips will be made by Intel. They need to be made there, to fulfill their own promises.

This is why I’m keeping money in Intel stock. It’s not about this quarter’s earnings, as nice as they look, and barely about next year. It’s about the rest of the decade — and America’s place in the new economy.

Leading indexes fell dramatically with the S&P 500 shedding 18.25% of its value. Hikes pounded the tech-heavy Nasdaq which fell by more than 30% during the same period. The emergence of AI, along with slowing rate hikes, has catalyzed a rebound in the markets in 2023. However, major indexes haven’t reached their 2021 highs. With inflation falling and rate hikes nearly over there’s reason to believe that the markets- and stocks could surge past their high marks in 2021. Let’s dive into a few of the top stocks to watch before new peaks.

Stocks to Watch Before New Peaks: AMD (AMD) man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% Upside

Source: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.com

I’ve been saying the same thing about AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) stock for the past few weeks. If you’ve read my articles during that period, this will be a bit repetitive. That said, it remains true and serves as a logical basis for prices to move upward: AMD is not that far behind its main rival, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).

The reason to believe that this is true lies in research recently released by MosaicML, a machine learning firm that was recently acquired by Databricks. MosaicML undertook extensive testing of the second-most powerful chips from AMD and Nvidia in relation to their AI prowess.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The result was particularly inspiring for AMD champions: Its chips are nearly as fast as those from Nvidia. Further, AMD’s relative strengths in software development are particularly relevant to AI. The software has been identified as an area from which rapid AI improvements will emerge. It all points to the idea that AMD could run much higher. AMD hit $154 in 2021 and currently stands at $111.

Stocks to Watch Before New Peaks: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""

Source: PX Media / Shutterstock

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock traded roughly $5 higher at its 2021 peak from its current price. You may be tempted to believe that those higher prices are logical given that it was one of the major firms to produce a Covid-19 vaccine. The logic is that revenues spiked on its approval and that Johnson & Johnson lacks a similar catalyst at the moment.

Story continues

While it’s true that there is no similar catalyst for the firm at the moment, there’s a simple reason to believe in JNJ shares. Johnson & Johnson’s revenues reached $94.94 billion in 2021. In 2023, they’re expected to eclipse $100 billion. Is that astronomical growth by any stretch of the imagination? No, not all. However, it does prove that JNJ is bigger than it was even when it had a Covid-19 vaccine. The other vaccine winners, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) will have far smaller revenue bases in 2023 than each did in 2021, respectively.

JNJ is the most stable of the bunch. Its revenues will be greater in 2023 than in 2021. Thus, its price-to-sales ratio is more attractive at the moment. Add in JNJ’s dividend and the choice gets even easier.

Stocks to Watch Before New Peaks: Coca-Cola (KO) Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker cryptos

Source: Epic Cure / Shutterstock

Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) shares traded for $60 at their peak in 2021. KO stock currently trades for $62.50 so it has actually surpassed its 2021 highs. Nevertheless, it remains worth considering at this point.

The firm released second-quarter earnings on July 26 which were very strong. Those earnings showed that sales remain very strong, growing at 6% with organic revenue growing at 11%.

That allowed management to raise its full-year forecast for organic revenue growth to between 8-9% from a previous 7-8% in 2023. The results come as Coca-Cola has raised prices even as consumers are already dealing with inflation that erodes their purchasing power. It indicates that demand remains very strong overall.

It’s difficult to find much fault in Coca-Cola’s execution and results even if you feel they could have given consumers a break in pricing. Shareholders are certainly happy. EPS increased by 34%, reaching $0.59. KO stock’s dividend is a bonus and yields nearly 3% currently.

Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.

Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.com

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) currently makes a lot of sense as a stock investment. The search giant just released second-quarter earnings that were much better than expected and should galvanize a period in which share prices rise.

Revenues for the quarter reached $74.6 billion, ahead of the $72.9 billion Wall Street had been expecting. That earnings beat will be consequential for investors over the coming weeks and months. The beat led to strong income growth of 14.79%(1) which was another bright spot for the firm.

Revenue growth reached 7% on a year-over-year basis down from 13% a year earlier. Slowing growth rates should matter but I’d argue they’re less of a concern due to the overall trajectory. Alphabet is expecting more than $300 billion in sales this year which is a turnaround from the $283 billion in 2022. Search, advertising, Cloud, and other bets are all growing and as rate hikes stop GOOG stock is in a strong position overall relative to its 2021 peak prices.

Meta Platforms (META)  hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks

Source: shutterstock.com/CC7

Investors should consider riding the upward momentum in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock. The fundamental case underpinning that idea is very solid. That’s where we’ll start.

Here’s what I particularly like about META shares currently: Even though the firm’s revenues grew in both the last 3 months and the last 6 months, net income did not. It decreased on a year-over-year basis during the most recent 6 months. However, it increased on a year-over-year basis during the latest 3-month period on a year-over-year basis. That suggests that Meta Platforms is doing much better now and that a real turnaround is in effect.

That’s true despite the fact that Reality Labs’ losses are getting bigger. Ad revenues and its Facebook and Instagram apps have rebounded. That’s very important to the overall narrative for Meta. The economy looks to have dodged the worst outcomes of rate hikes at this point. That should inspire businesses to spend more on ad revenue and continue to bolster META shares in the process.

Albemarle (ALB)  tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocks

Source: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.com

Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) has emerged as one of the more important EV stocks over the past few years. Its position is secured in the sector. Lithium demand is expected to grow. Those factors are powerful and have led Albemarle to make bold projections that should have investor interest piqued.

Before I get into that, let me quickly note how rapidly Albemarle is growing. In Q1, revenues grew by 129% reaching $2.6 billion while net income rose by 389%. Even though prices were not stable those results proved that lithium demand is massive on EV sales that aren’t weakening.

Let’s get back to those projections. Albemarle increased its 2030 lithium demand forecast by 15% over its previous expectations early this year. The company anticipates increasing demand through 2030 paired with a supply shortfall. The economic takeaway is clear: Prices are going to rise over the long term. Current prices make for a good entry point.

Microsoft (MSFT)  Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks

Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares recently tested new all-time highs of $350 before quickly falling to $330. I think the market has got it wrong: MSFT stock is worth $350 per share. The decline is an opportunity.

The reason to believe so is simple: Microsoft traded at $330 in 2021, a year in which the company reported $168 in sales. It could eclipse $240 billion in sales this year. Thus, its price-to-sales ratio clearly favors the notion that share prices could burst above $350 moving forward.

Why shouldn’t investors believe that idea? After all, Microsoft has made massive strides in AI. It is finding new revenue streams therein. Office 365 AI integrations are the latest news on that front. Time will tell how that goes. In any case, Microsoft is now a better firm than it was back in 2021 when it traded at a similar price. It’s a very simple, logical argument, and simple, logical arguments are often very powerful.

11,2023-07-31T21:57:00+00:00,Advanced Micro Devices Q2 Preview: Time to Buy?,"It’s the busiest week of earnings season, with an extensive list of companies scheduled to unveil their quarterly results.

There are several notable names on the reporting docket, including the highly-followed Advanced Micro Devices AMD. AMD shares have been big-time outperformers in 2023 so far, up more than 70% following a brutal 2022 showing.

But how does the semiconductor titan stack up heading into its quarterly release? Let’s take a closer look at expectations and results from a few other chip players, including NXP Semiconductors NXPI and Intel INTC, as a light guide.

Intel

Intel posted better-than-expected Q2 results, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 420%. Quarterly revenue totaled $12.9 billion, 8% ahead of expectations and down from the year-ago quarter.

The market took the results in stride, with Intel shares finding plenty of buyers post-earnings. Impressively, both top and bottom line results exceeded the higher end of previous guidance. Zacks Investment Research

NXP Semiconductors

NXP Semiconductors also posted better-than-expected top and bottom line results, exceeding EPS expectations by 5% and delivering a 3% revenue beat. Similar to INTC, the company’s revenue results were at the high end of previous guidance, undoubtedly a positive.

And the market took the results well, with NXPI shares seeing bullish activity post-earnings. Zacks Investment Research

Advanced Micro Devices

Analysts have been silent for the quarter to be reported over the last several months, with the $0.57 per share estimate unchanged. The value reflects a 45% pullback in earnings from the year-ago quarter. Zacks Investment Research

The story remains primarily the same regarding the top line, with the $5.3 billion quarterly estimate down a fractional 0.1% since the beginning of May. Sales are forecasted to decline along with earnings, with the estimate suggesting an 18% pullback year-over-year.

Story continues Zacks Investment Research

In addition, AMD has been a consistent earnings performer as of late, exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations in nine of its last ten releases. Just in its latest print, AMD delivered a 7% EPS beat paired with a modest revenue surprise.

It’s worth noting that the market has been impressed with the last two releases, with AMD shares seeing notable bullish momentum post-earnings. This is illustrated by the green arrows circled in the chart below. Zacks Investment Research

Investors will closely be monitoring AMD’s Data Center results, especially as Wall Street continues to obsess over artificial intelligence (AI). For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Data Center revenue stands at $1.3 billion, implying a pullback of roughly 9% from the year-ago quarter.

Putting Everything Together

Investors will closely be monitoring AMD’s quarterly results, as the stock has become a household name in the semiconductor space.

Several other semiconductor names, including Intel INTC and NXP Semiconductors NXPI, have already unveiled their respective quarterly results, with both companies posting better-than-expected results and seeing buying pressure post-earnings.

For Advanced Micro Devices’ AMD quarter to be reported, analysts have primarily left their top and bottom line expectations unchanged, with both earnings and revenue forecasted to pull back from the year-ago quarter.

Please refer to these files for more detailed information. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe?

Joseph Hogan: Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our second quarter results and discuss a few highlights from our two operating segments, system services and clear aligners. John will provide more detail on our Q2 financial performance and comment on our views for the third quarter and 2023 overall. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points, and we'll open the call to questions. Overall, I'm pleased to report another better-than-expected quarter with Q2 revenues and operating margins that exceeded our guidance. Q2 results reflect improving trends across regions, strength in teen and younger patient volumes, driven by momentum in both submitters and utilization as well as continued growth from Invisalign First.

In the Teen segment, which represents the largest portion of the 21 million annual orthodontic case starts, 195,000 teens and kids started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners during the second quarter. An increase of 7% sequentially and 10% year-over-year, reflecting the highest annual growth rate in the teen segment since 2021. For Systems & Services, second quarter revenues of $169.5 million were up 10.5% sequentially and down very slightly 1% year-over-year. For Q2, sequential increases in systems and services revenues, reflects increased scanner volumes across the regions and higher services and non-system revenues, reflecting increased sales of certified pre-owned or what we call CPO scanners and higher subscription revenues. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 services revenues increased primarily due to higher subscription revenues from a large number of iTero scanners in the field.

We also had higher non-system scanner revenues related to our certified pre-owned again CPOs and our scanner leasing and rental programs. For Q2, total clear aligner revenues of $832.7 million up 5.4% sequentially and 4.3% year-over-year. Q2 sequential revenue growth rate is consistent with our historical three year average and reflects growth across all regions. Q2 non-case revenues at $80 million were up 6.2% sequentially and 18% year-over-year, reflecting continued growth from Vivera retainers and Invisalign Doctor Subscription Program, or DSP, our monthly subscription-based clear aligner program. And Commerce sales for aligner-related consumables, like aligner cases and whitening and cleaning products. DSP has been successful in addressing an important and growing opportunity for experienced Invisalign doctors.

It is our first subscription-based clear aligner program that enables doctors to reach new patients and provide them with a better overall experience. DSP enables doctors flexibilities to treat simple touch-up cases or offer their patients a superior, flexible, and convenient retention solution. We introduced DSP in the United States and Canada in 2021. We expanded it to Spain and the Nordic countries in Q2 2023, and we'll launch DSP in France and the United Kingdom in the second half of this year. We have also extended DSP to DSO partners who recognize the value of our Invisalign subscription aligner put model. Over the past two years, our DSP subscription program has continued to ramp and in Q2 drove strong volume growth in touch-up cases typically five to 10 stage cases of aligners.

For Q2 '23, we shipped over 18,000 DSP touch-up cases in North America, up from 15,500 in Q1 '23 and more than double the case volume in Q2 '22 last year. Given its continued success and contribution to our growth this year, DSP touch-up cases are included in my overall commentary for clear aligners. Otherwise, specified in my remarks, our case volumes and metrics do not include DSP and touch up cases. For Q2, total clear aligner volumes were up 5% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. Q2 clear aligner volumes, including DSP touch-up cases, were up 5.4% sequentially and up 2.4% year-over-year. For the Americas, Q2 clear aligner volumes reflect sequential growth across the region from both ortho and GP dentist channels, an increase in teen case starts driven by momentum from Invisalign First and increased adult patients from the GP dentist channel.

In North America, adoption of the Invisalign Comprehensive three and three product drove sequential volume growth. For Q2, North American ortho utilization was up sequentially and down a fraction year-over-year, including DSP touch-up cases. Q2 North American ortho utilization was up both sequentially and year-over-year as noted in our Q2 '23 earnings slides. For EMEA, Q2 clear aligner volumes were up sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting growth across the region and continued adoption of Invisalign Moderate, Invisalign Comprehensive three and three products as well as an increase in teen case starts, which grew sequentially and year-over-year driven by Invisalign First and our new Invisalign Teen case packs. On a sequential basis, clear aligner growth was led by Iberia, Italy, DACH, and Turkey.

For APAC, Q2 clear aligner volumes were up sequentially and up year-over-year, reflecting improving trends in China as well as other key markets like Japan, Taiwan, Korea and India. Q2 APAC results also reflect increased Invisalign submitters and higher utilization, especially for teen patients, driven by growth from Invisalign First in the orthodontic channel, which is especially important as we enter the China team season in Q3. Q2 APAC results also reflect growth in the GP channel with increased Invisalign submitters and higher utilization sequentially and year-over-year. During Q2, we continued to roll out the Invisalign Comprehensive three and three product in APAC, where it is now available in Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan, and India. We plan to launch Invisalign three and three in China in Q3.

We are also pleased with the additional adoption of three and three product in APAC, where the majority of cases treated are comprehensive, allowing our doctor customers more flexibility within the Invisalign product portfolio. In June, we hosted 2023 Invisalign APAC Summit in Singapore and brought together nearly a 1,000 orthodontists and general practitioners, dentists and clinic staff from 18 countries across the Asia Pacific region. The Summit showcased Invisalign and iTero products, the Align Digital platform and the recent and upcoming innovations, while also highlighting our doctors' experience with digital transformation, and how it improves the patient treatment journey. Attendees joined expert sessions focused on enhancing treatment planning efficiency, optimizing digital workflows, addressing the unique needs of teens and younger patients in exploring the essential aspect shaping today's digitally driven orthodontic practices.

Teen orthodontic treatment is the largest segment of the orthodontic market worldwide and represents our largest opportunity for clear aligner sales to Orthos. We continue to focus on gaining share from traditional metal braces through teen-specific sales and marketing programs and product features unique to the Invisalign system. For Q2, total clear aligner cases for teenagers were up 7% sequentially and 9.7% year-over-year, reflecting improving trends across the regions. On a sequential basis, growth was driven by increased submitters in the APAC and EMEA regions on a year-over-year basis. TNK starts were in the APAC region, driven by increased submitters and in the EMEA region, driven by increased submitters and utilization, both in the orthodontic channel.

Last year, we introduced the Teen Case Packs in the United States and Canada, and in Q1, Q2, we launched them in France, Scandinavia and Iberia. For the quarter, Teen Case Packs increased sequentially and year-over-year, driven by strength in EMEA. Invisalign First also was up sequentially and year-over-year across all regions and continues to drive adoption of Invisalign treatment among young patients. Invisalign First aligners are designed for Phase 1 treatment, typically in growing children six to 10 years old, making up about 20% of orthodontic case starts. For the dental service organizations, or DSO customers, Q2 clear aligner volumes increased sequentially primarily from the Americas region. Overall, clear aligner growth rate from DSO doctors continues to outpace non-DSO doctors and our DST touch-up cases are ramping nicely up as DSO doctors understand the value of the subscription program brings regarding pricing and flexibility for their patients.

Invisalign is one of the most trusted brands in the orthodontic industry globally among both doctors and patients. On the consumer marketing front, we delivered $10.3 billion impressions and had 30.9 million visits to our website in Q2 '23. To increase awareness and educate young adults, parents teams about the benefits of Invisalign brand, we continue to invest in top media platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, Instagram across all markets as well as key social media influencers and brand ambassadors. In the Americas, we focused on reaching young adults as well as teens and their parents through our influencer and creator-centric campaigns partnering with leading smile squad creators, including Marshall Martin, Rally Shaw, and Jeremy Lin.

Each of these creators shared their personal experiences with Invisalign treatment and why they chose to transform their smile with Invisalign aligners. Additionally, in the United States, we work closely with athletes over time, a high school sports social media platform that showcases the benefits of Invisalign treatment. Brand interest remained strong throughout the quarter with 9.2 million consumers visiting our websites in the Americas region, representing 17% growth year-on-year. In EMEA region, we partnered with new influencers to reach consumers across social media platforms, including TikTok and Meta. In Germany, we launched new testimonial campaigns highlighting the stories of 70 young adults and teens who share why they chose Invisalign treatment and how it impacted their lives.

Our consumer campaigns delivered more than 1.7 billion media impressions and 9.7 million visitors to our website. We continue to invest in consumer advertising across the APAC region, resulting in more than 12 million visitors to our websites and over $4.8 billion impression. We expanded our region in Japan and India via TikTok, Meta and YouTube. We partner with key influencers like [indiscernible]. We saw increased brand interest in consumers as evidenced by 270% year-over-year increase in unique visitors to our website in India and a 46% year-over-year increase in Japan. Adoption of My Invisalign consumer and patient apps continued to increase with 3.1 million downloads to date and over 350,000 monthly active users, a 28% year-over-year growth.

Uses of other digital tools also continue to increase. ClinCheck live update was used by 40,000 doctors on more than 580,000 cases, reducing time spent and modifying treatment by 20%. Invisalign practice app is increasing in adoption with 88,000 doctors who are actively using this app and 5.1 million photos were uploaded in Q2 via the Invisalign practice set. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.

John Morici: Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q2 financial results. Total revenues for the second quarter were $1.002 billion up 6.3% from the prior quarter and up 3.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Q2 '23 revenues were impacted by favorable foreign exchange of approximately $1.3 million or approximately 0.1% sequentially. And unfavorably impacted by approximately $19.4 million year-over-year or approximately 1.9%. Clear aligners Q2 revenues of $832.7 million were up 5.4% sequentially, primarily from higher volumes, higher non-case revenues and higher ASPs. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 clear aligner revenues were up 4.3%, primarily due to higher ASPs, higher non-case revenues and higher volumes.

For Q2, Invisalign ASPs for comprehensive treatment were down sequentially and up year-over-year. On a sequential basis, ASPs reflect larger discounts and product mix shift to lower-priced products partially offset by price increases. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in comprehensive ASPs reflect price increases and higher additional aligners, partially offset by product mix shift, larger discounts and unfavorable foreign exchange. For Q2, Invisalign ASPs for non-comprehensive treatment were up sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the increase in ASPs reflect lower discounts, higher additional aligners, price increases, and favorable foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in non-comprehensive ASPs reflect price increases and higher additional Aligners, partially offset by product mix shift, larger discounts and unfavorable foreign exchange.

In Q1 '23, we launched Invisalign Comprehensive three and three products in most markets, and we have continued to expand into more markets, as previously mentioned. The three and three configuration offers our doctor customers, our Invisalign comprehensive treatment with three additional aligners included within three years of the treatment end date, instead of unlimited additional aligners with five years of the treatment end date at the 2022 Invisalign comprehensive product price. Over time, we have come to learn that on average, Invisalign doctors complete a comprehensive Invisalign treatment with two or fewer additional aligners. We are pleased with the continued adoption of the Invisalign Comprehensive three and three product and anticipate that it will continue to grow, providing doctors the flexibility they desire and allowing us to recognize more revenue upfront with deferred revenue being recognized over a shorter period of time, compared to our traditional Invisalign comprehensive product.

As revenues from subscriptions, retainers, and ancillary products continue to grow globally, some of the historical metrics that only focus on case shipments are expected to account for a lesser percentage of our overall growth. In our earnings release and financial slides, you will see that we have added our total clear aligner revenue per case shipment, which we believe to be more indicative measure of our overall growth strategy. Q2 '23 clear aligner revenues impacted from favorable foreign exchange of approximately $1.2 million or approximately 0.1% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, clear aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $16.3 million or approximately 1.9%. Clear aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $13 million or up 1% sequentially and $138.6 million or up 12.2% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped.

Q2 '23 systems and services revenue of $169.5 million were up 10.5% sequentially, mostly due to higher scanner volume, higher revenues from our certified preowned program and higher services revenue from our larger base of scanners sold, partially offset by unfavorable ASPs. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 '23 systems and services revenue were down 1%, primarily due to lower scanner volume and unfavorable ASPs, partially offset by higher services revenues from our larger base of scanners sold and higher revenues from our CPO and leasing rental programs. Q2 '23 systems and services revenue were impacted from favorable foreign exchange of approximately $0.1 million or approximately 0.1% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, systems and services revenue were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $3.1 million or approximately 1.8%.

Systems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was down $2.3 million or 0.8% sequentially, primarily due to the decrease in the deferral of service revenues included with our scanner purchase and up $8.6 million or 3.3% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales, and the deferral of service revenues included with our scanner purchase, which will be recognized ratably over the service period. As our scanner portfolio expands, and we introduced new products, we increased the opportunities for customers to upgrade, make trade-ins, and provide refurbished scanners for certain markets. As such, our model is changing. We expect to continue growing our programs and as offering our CPO units for purchase and selling the way the customer -- our customers desire.

Developing new capital equipment opportunities to meet the digital transformation needs of our customers and DSO partners, is a natural progression for our equipment business with a large and growing base of scanner sold. Moving on to gross margin. Second quarter overall gross margin was 71.2%, up 1.2 points sequentially and up 0.3 points year-over-year. Overall gross margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately 0.5 points on a year-over-year basis. Clear aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 72.4%, up 0.7 points sequentially, primarily due to the lower mix of additional aligners, favorable manufacturing variances and higher ASPs. Clear aligner gross margin for the second quarter was down 0.9 points year-over-year, primarily due to increased manufacturing spend as we continue to ramp up operations at our new manufacturing facility in Poland and a higher mix of additional aligner volume, partially offset by higher ASPs and lower freight.

Systems and Services gross margin for the second quarter was 65.1%, up 3.5 points sequentially, primarily from lower service and freight costs, partially offset by lower ASPs. Systems and Services gross margin for the second quarter was up 5.3 points year-over-year, primarily from lower service and freight costs and higher services revenue, partially offset by lower ASPs. Q2 operating expenses were $541.7 million, up sequentially 2.8% and up 8.5% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up $14.5 million, primarily from higher consumer marketing spend and higher incentive compensation. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $42.3 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and our continued investments in sales and R&D activities, partially offset by controlled spending on advertising and marketing as part of our efforts to proactively manage costs.

On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation, and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, partially offset by restructuring and other charges, operating expenses were $505 million up 2.9% sequentially and up 8.4% year-over-year. Our second quarter operating income of $171.9 million resulted in an operating margin of 17.2% up 3 points sequentially and down 2.2 points year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating margin is primarily attributed to higher gross margin, as well as favorable impact from foreign exchange of 0.1 points. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily attributed to investments in our go-to-market teams and technology, as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 1.1 points.

On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions, offset by restructuring other charges, operating margin for the second quarter was 21.3%, and up 2.8 points sequentially and down 2 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense net for the second quarter was a loss of $0.3 million compared to an income of $1.1 million in the first quarter and a loss of $14.6 million in the second quarter a year ago, primarily due to foreign exchange. The GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 34.8%, consistent with the first quarter effective tax rate of 34.8% and 35% in the second quarter of the prior year. As a reminder, in Q4 2022, we changed our methodology for the computation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate to a long-term projected tax rate and have given effect to the new methodology from January 1, 2022, and recast previously reported quarterly results in 2022.

Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the second quarter was 20%, reflecting the change in our methodology. Second quarter net income per diluted share was $1.46, up sequentially $0.32 and up $0.02 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.02 on a sequential basis and unfavorably impacted by $0.15 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.22 for the second quarter, up $0.40 sequentially and up $0.07 year-over-year. Note that the prior year 2022 non-GAAP net income per diluted share in our prior year 2022 non-GAAP reflects the Q4 2022 change in our methodology for the computation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and short-term, and long-term marketable securities were $133.8 billion up sequentially $112.4 million and up $56.6 million year-over-year.

Of our $133.8 billion balance $314.3 million was held in the U.S. and $719.5 million was held by our international entities. In Q2, we completed a $75 million equity investment in Heartland Dental a multi-disciplinary DSO with GP and ortho practices across the U.S. During Q1 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program to succeed the 2021 $1 billion program. Currently, $1 billion remains available for repurchase under the 2023 $1 billion stock repurchase program. Q2 accounts receivable balance was $908.4 million, up sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 81 days, down approximately two days sequentially and down approximately four days as compared to Q2 last year. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $251.9 million.

Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $58.5 million, primarily related to our continued investments to increase aligner manufacturing capacity in facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures amounted to $193.3 million. Now turning to our outlook. As Joe mentioned earlier, we are pleased with our Q2 results. While the macroeconomic environment still remains uncertain, we have seen improvements in the operating environment and the consumer demand signals that influence our outlook. For Q3 2023, we anticipate our worldwide revenue to be in the range of $990 million to $1.01 billion, up approximately 12% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect our Q3 2023 GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly up from Q2 2023 as we continue to strategically prioritize our investments in R&D and go-to-market activities to drive growth.

For full-year 2023, assuming no circumstances occur that are beyond our control, we anticipate our 2023 worldwide revenue to be in the range of $3.97 billion to $3.99 billion, up approximately 7% year-over-year at the midpoint. We also expect our full-year 2023 GAAP operating margin to be slightly above 17% and our 2023 non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above 21%, a 1 point improvement from the guidance we provided in April of 2023. For 2023, we expect investments in capital expenditures to be approximately $200 million. Capital expenditures are expected to primarily relate to building construction improvements as well as manufacturing capacity in support of our continued international expansion. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments.

Joe?

Joseph Hogan: At our continued growth despite the economic slowdown in uncertain environment. Q2 results demonstrate our resilience and adaptability. While we cannot predict future economic conditions, we're confident in our ability to focus and execute on our strategic growth initiatives. As a leader in digital transformation, we offer a powerful suite of innovative digital tools that make up the aligned digital platform, which provides a seamless end-to-end digital experience for doctors and their patients. Innovations launched over the last year include ClinCheck live update for 3D controls. This enables doctors to generate modified Invisalign patient treatment plans in real time, reducing modifications that used to take weeks to as little as two minutes.

Improving practice productivity while also improving the quality of treatment plans. Invisalign Personal Plan, or IPP streamlines the treatment planning process and helps doctors achieve their desired treatment plans more consistently and efficiently. Invisalign Smile Architect allows general dentists to integrate clear aligner therapy into their comprehensive treatment plans by combining tooth alignment and restorative planning in a single platform. Invisalign Virtual Care, equips doctor with a next generation remote monitoring solution that has new artificial intelligence assisted capabilities to streamline their workflows. Cowen being computed tomography or CVCT, enables doctors to visualize the patient's roots as part of the digital treatment planning process.

Invisalign Outcome Simulator Pro, expand Align's existing Invisalign outcome simulator technology and adds the benefit of the company's ClinCheck in-face visualization tool that combines a photo of a patient's face, with their 3D treatment simulation, creating a truly personalized view of how their new smile will look. Itero-exocad Connector integrates iTero intraoral camera and NIRI images with exocad DentalCAD 3.1 software, and allows dental professionals to visualize the internal and external structure of teeth. In addition to these and other incredible innovations in the coming years, we'll continue to build a digital platform and add new capabilities to improve clinical outcomes and elevate the patient experience to drive continued practice growth and positive patient experiences.

Thank you for your time today. We look forward to speaking to you at our upcoming Investor Day on September 6, where we'll share with you our views about the incredible market opportunity we have and how Align is uniquely positioned to continue to lead the transformation of the digital orthodontic industry. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?

The July Rate Hike

On July 26, the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates once again, this time by 25 basis points. The 0.25% hike has brought interest rates up to about 5.25% to 5.50%, which is the highest level of interest rates in over 22 years. The decision to hike rates this month was unanimous at the Fed, and it was also signaled that the public can expect to see even further rate hikes up ahead this year. Considering this hike, the investing community continues to be plagued with inflation-related concerns and what the current interest rate levels will mean for businesses and consumers heading into the second half of the year. For many, the jump to such a high level of interest rates is proving to be a source of market uncertainty and turbulence, while others are holding on to the belief that the Fed will manage to bring inflation down to a maximum rate of 2% in the long run, as has been affirmed in the Federal Open Market Committee statement.

In light of this hike, in a CNBC interview on July 26, David Kelly from JPMorgan Asset Management made the following comments on how he views stocks progressing in the market over the next six months and beyond:

""I look at valuations a lot and I do worry about the mega-cap stocks that have really led this charge. But overall I think it good be pretty good because the key point is, eventually inflations gonna get back down to where we were in the last decade, it's gonna get back down to 2%. Eventually, the Fed's gonna have to react to a recession and cut rates back down again and so you get back to a slow growth, low inflation environment in which companies are very good at maintaining margins. I mean that's the other message that we've seen from the earnings reports so far this month. You know, there's a problem with revenues, but they're doing a great job at maintaining margins. I think US companies can do well in a cold climate, and I think the stock market is taking comfort from that.""

Navigating The Market After The Hike

According to Kelly, it is becoming increasingly important to keep an eye on stock valuations heading into the second half of the year to ensure one does not end up with overpriced stocks in the event of a market correction. For him, the choice sectors to keep an eye on include industrials and financials. Overall though, Kelly's opinion seems to be that even in the event of a recession, US companies can be expected to perform well enough to satisfy their shareholders.

Considering the above, it has become abundantly clear that investors today should really consider factors like stock valuations, potential impacts of the recent rate hike, higher prices, and much more when they are making their investments. Another factor that might be worth considering is the performance of companies that are steadily gaining popularity among the younger generations of consumers and investors today.

Shares of value-oriented beauty brand ELF received a meaningful boost from normalizing beauty usage and spending in a post-COVID environment, which we believe has contributed to its premium multiple relative to competitors in the beauty space.

Crocs designs, develops, manufactures and distributes casual footwear and accessories for men, women and children. The company invented the molded plastic Clog in 2002 and has turned it into a $3B global revenue base. We believe revenue growth will continue to surprise to the upside driven by expansion opportunities outside the US, demand from new product introductions (including from recently acquired Hey Dude) and a distribution push both within the direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels. Given the company is still small in terms of a global market share (its $4B in revenues puts them at 1% global market share of the footwear industry), we believe there is a long runway for growth and initiated a GardenSM position.”

Since that time, it has been a disruptor of the traditional use of wire and bracket braces to straighten teeth and treat malocclusions. While it is leader in the clear aligner category with roughly 85-90% market share, the bigger competition is taking share from wire and brackets and on that measure, it only has 10-15% share of the overall teeth straightening market. Over time, through innovation and vertical integration, the company has evolved to be able to treat over 90% of all cases. Further, it has done a great job deepening relationships with orthodontists and general practitioner dentists over time. All in all, we believe this is a business with a durable competitive advantage, operating in a large, growing and very attractive industry, led by a proven and long-term oriented management team, with a very long runway ahead of it to grow and compound at very attractive rates.”

18,2023-07-31T17:18:49+00:00,AI 'driving' valuation growth for Big Tech stocks: Analyst,"Tech companies like AMD, Qualcomm, and NVIDIA are set to report earnings in August. Constellation Research Principal Analyst and Founder R ""Ray"" Wang joins Yahoo Finance Live to talk about what he calls ""MATANA"" stocks, also known as Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Alphabet, NVIDIA, and Amazon. Wang explains how ""AI is driving the valuation growth"" and how ""there was pre-Chat GPT and then post-Chat GPT,"" for these tech stocks.

Video Transcript

RACHELLE AKUFFO: So still confident in the MATANA stocks here. But as we talk about generative AI, what are the key differentiators in how these companies are mentioning and using it?

R ""RAY"" WANG: Yeah. There's a great difference between the folks that are actually using it, the folks that are actually producing it, and the folks that are supplying the tools to make it happen, right? And the tool makers, of course, are the Nvidia's of the world with the GBUs and of course, Google in the future with TPUs and then Microsoft if they get into the chip game. And then of course, we've got the companies that are actually doing the processing, which is in the cloud.

So you see that with Google, Amazon, Microsoft leading that way, and then you've got companies that are using it like Adobe, Oracle, ServiceNow and C3. Those are the ones that are creating this AI empire. And we do see that. AI is driving the valuation growth. We were dead in November 2022. There was pre-ChatGPT and then post ChatGPT. You could see the tech starts starting to grow. So that's the big thing.

But the second thing we discovered was ads are back for the few companies that are left and the ones that are actually growing, of course-- here's where Meta comes into play, Google comes into play, and what we'll be looking for is Amazon and Apple. Apple doesn't break out its advertising revenues, but Amazon is now the third largest digital ad player in the market.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: And we knew that there was this pull back in ad spending. Why do you think people are honing back into some of these stalwarts when it comes to eyes for consumers and ads?

Story continues

R ""RAY"" WANG: Rachelle, it's a great question. I think what happens is if you've got the network, you've got the power to reach out to folks, and there are very few mass marketing capabilities left. And so Amazon has amazing reach because of commerce, Google has amazing reach because of search, and of course, Alphabet or-- Alphabet has amazing reach because of search.

And then of course, we're seeing what's going on with Facebook because of the network effects on Meta. Now that also means other companies like Spotify, who are showing some growth. Yes, music isn't going to carry you all the way. Netflix subscriptions aren't going to carry all the way and you need to have multiple monetization models to be able to survive.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: And of course, we have to talk about the cloud, especially as we look at what happened with Microsoft's drop in cloud growth here. What is the story there? And how temporary is? Is this part of a new normal? A shift that we should expect when it comes to cloud.

R ""RAY"" WANG: Well, the reason I say it's cloudy times ahead is because we're seeing some interesting usage of the cloud. A lot of companies just took their stuff and put it onto the cloud and hoped it was going to get cheaper, but now a new class of CIOs are doing something different. They're taking cloud hosting costs and cloud operating costs from maybe $1,000 a month and getting it down to $100 a month.

And so we're about to see some rationalization and cloud usage just as of AI is picking up. And so we've got to see what happens if cloud contracts are coming down or if cloud usage is going to go down. And so Microsoft got through that. Amazon, we're going to watch very carefully on what their numbers are on August 3, and that will give us an indicator of what's going on. But Google didn't do too bad. They are flat at 28%. It is the summer, and we're going to see more pickup usually in the fall.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: And of course, we have to talk Apple whether it's becoming that $3 trillion stock or whether it's-- what they're doing with their own sort of chip making there. What are your expectations and have they really outperformed the way that you thought they would?

R ""RAY"" WANG: No, they've done really well given where the market is. There's an expectation that revenues are going to decline again in this quarter. It's been two quarters of decline, but we're still in a supercycle of refresh for iPhones, and it's not about the number of iPhone sales, and we won't see iPhone 15 sales if they make that announcement in the future. What this is about is how much can be made per iPhone. It's about the services revenue and Apple's story around that is very important. It's because they've been able to grow the revenue per device, and that's an important number to look at.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: And I want to talk Amazon as well because we've talked about cloud, especially when it comes to Microsoft there. But what about Amazon as well and the growth story there? Because I mean, we're hearing bits and bobs about their AI plans as well but not really as-- it's not really a big topic of conversation to the extent that we would have expected.

R ""RAY"" WANG: Yeah, so here's the interesting thing. There's been a lot of cost cutting at core Amazon. They've actually rejiggered their supply chains and their capacity and their warehouses, but they've improved the automation and what they're able to do now is deliver at a package or deliver any kind of parcel at a cost lower than anybody else, more automated than anyone else, and more track than anyone else, which means they can start using AI machine learning internally to drive down the cost.

And then the second piece is where is AWS growth? And AWS, right now, is actually winning among partner mindshares. Large partners are actually being embraced by AWS, which wasn't the case in the past, and they're seeing that level of growth that's very, very different than some of the other partnerships that we've seen in the cloud. So we're looking at those two factors-- core Amazon performance, and of course, what's going on with AWS.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ai-driving-valuation-growth-big-171849913.html,"['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'AMZ.F', 'AMZ.XETRA', 'AMZN.MX', 'AMZN.US', 'AMZO34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'GOGL34.SA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOG.MI', 'GOOG.MX', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US']",[],"{'polarity': 0.999, 'neg': 0.012, 'neu': 0.874, 'pos': 0.115}",Alphabet Inc,1,2023-07-31T17:18:49+00:00,Alphabet Inc
19,2023-07-31T19:58:57+00:00,20 Worst Performing Economies in 2023,"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 20 worst performing economies in 2023. To skip our detailed analysis of the global economies, you can go directly to 5 Worst Performing Economies in 2023.

Global Economic Outlook

The global economy is facing a transition from the massive economic downfall during the pandemic and Russia’s war against Ukraine. The global economy was negatively impacted by the supply chain issues following the lockdown during the pandemic. However, supply chain disruptions are shrinking and businesses are improving around the world. At the same time, the monetary policies of central banks should begin to produce the outcomes, with the inflation rate expected to move back toward its target. In 2023, the global economy is expected to slowly get back on track.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its July 2023 World Economic Outlook highlights that global growth will drop to 3% in both 2023 and 2024, falling from an estimated 3.5% in 2022. Global inflation will continue to decrease but at a much slower rate than initially anticipated, from 8.7% in 2022 to 6.8% in 2023. The core inflation is expected to remain moderate, and inflation forecast for 2024 has been revised upward. The main cause behind this was the COVID-19 pandemic and trade tensions after the Russia-Ukraine war. During the press briefing of the July 2023 World Economic Outlook, the following comments were made regarding economic development:

""The global economy continues to gradually recover from the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but it is not yet out of the woods. The COVID-19 health crisis is officially over, supply chain disruptions have returned to pre-pandemic levels, economic activity in the first quarter of the year proved resilient, and labor markets are quite tight in many places. Energy and food prices have come down faster than expected from the war-induced peaks. And financial instability following the March banking turmoil remains contained thanks to forceful actions by the U.S. and Swiss authorities.

Stronger growth and lower inflation than expected are welcome news, suggesting the global economy is headed in the right direction. Yet growth remains low by historical standards, and while some adverse risks have moderated, the balance remains tilted to the downside, and it is too early to celebrate. There are growing signs that global activity is losing momentum. The global tightening of monetary policy has brought interest rates into contractionary territory. This has started to weigh down on activity, slowing the growth of credit to the nonfinancial sector, increasing households' and firms' interest payments, and putting pressure on real estate markets.

Second core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, remains well above central bank targets, and is expected to decline only gradually. In advanced economies, core inflation is expected to remain unchanged at 5.1 percent this year before declining to 3.1 percent in 2024. Clearly, the battle against inflation is not yet won.

Key to inflation's persistence will be labor market developments and wage profit dynamics. Despite tight labor markets, overall wage inflation has increased, but remains behind price inflation in most countries. The reason is simple and has little to do with so called greedflation. Prices adjust upwards faster than wages when nominal demand far exceeds what the economy can produce. As a result, real wages have declined. If labor markets remain strong, we should expect and welcome real wages recovering lost ground. Indeed the gap between nominal wage growth and price inflation has started to close. Because firms' profit margins have grown robustly in the last two years, we remain confident that there is room to accommodate the rebound in real wages without triggering a wage price spiral. With inflation expectations well-anchored in major economies and the economy slowing, market pressures should help contain the passthrough from labor cost to prices.""

Story continues

In the medium term, overall economic growth is expected to slow down. Especially, developed economies are expected to face a slowdown in their economy, as the growth is expected to fall from 2.7% in 2022 to 1.5% in 2023. In comparison, the growth in developing economies and emerging markets is expected to remain stable at 4% in 2023 and 4.1% in 2024. According to the World Economic Forum’s Chief Economists' Outlook, the global economy seems gloomy. The majority of chief economists project moderate or strong growth in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia. Some of the most important economies in the world from the following regions include Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, India, and Japan.

How are Businesses Recovering?

After a long halt during the pandemic, companies from different sectors are making strong progress. Most importantly, it depends on the sector in which a company is operating. Some sectors have performed exceptionally well while some have been struggling. So far in 2023, the worst performing sectors have been healthcare, energy, and utilities. For instance, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) shares have plunged almost 30% since the start of the year, as of July 31. Whereas, consumer discretionary and technology have outperformed other sectors in the market. As we mentioned earlier, the tech sector is having a great time this year. Most investors are betting on tech stocks regardless of high inflation concerns. One of the main reasons why the tech sector has skyrocketed is the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) hype. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google is making massive progress in AI as the customers are highly interested in its cloud services. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai believes that in the long-term, AI will potentially expand Google's total addressable market and allow them to win new customers. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has some big tech competitors in AI including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

On July 28, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) released its earnings for the second quarter of 2023. The company posted earnings per share of $1.44, beating the expectations of $0.10. The company posted revenue of $74.60 billion and surpassed the consensus by $1.85 billion. Google continues to progress with its cloud business and advance in AI. With so much hope around Google's AI technology and future AI plans, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has soared 10% this week. During the Q2 2023 earnings call, the company made the following comments:

""The momentum across the Company drove our results this quarter. We delivered solid performance in Search and YouTube and ongoing strong growth in Cloud, where we remain focused on long-term value creation. And we continue our important work to operate more efficiently, creating durable savings to fund investments in our biggest priorities.

I’ll talk about this momentum, including our continued leadership in AI and our excitement about the evolution of Search. At I/O, we shared how we are making AI helpful for everyone in four important ways: first, improving knowledge and learning. This is our seventh year as an AI-first company, and we intuitively know how to incorporate AI into our products. Large language models make them even more helpful, models like PaLM 2 and soon Gemini, which we are building to be multimodal. These advances provide an opportunity to reimagine many of our products, including our most important product, Search. We are in a period of incredible innovation for Search, which has continuously evolved over the years. This quarter saw our next major evolution with the launch of the Search Generative Experience, or SGE, which uses the power of generative AI to make search even more natural and intuitive.

User feedback has been very positive so far. It can better answer the queries people come to us with today, while also unlocking entirely new types of questions that Search can answer. For example, we found that generative AI can connect the dots for people as they explore a topic or project, helping them weigh multiple factors and personal preferences before making a purchase or booking a trip. We see this new experience as another jumping off point for exploring the web, enabling users to go deeper to learn about a topic. I’m proud of the engineering excellence underlying our progress. Since the May launch, we’ve boosted serving efficiency, reducing the time it takes to generate AI snapshots by half. We’ll deliver even faster responses over time.

We have made good progress in data center machine efficiency, which will pay dividends as we continue to invest in AI. We continue to slow our expense growth and pace of hiring and ensure our teams are aligned to our highest priorities. This quarter, we reallocated a number of teams, including aligning Waze’s ad sales with our existing business organization. We are combining various engineering efforts across core infrastructure and cloud. Products like Bard and SGE are being built by small fast-moving teams that have been reallocated to these high-priority efforts. Overall, we are actively moving people to higher priority activities within the Company, and we continue to optimize our real estate footprint for current and future needs. Next, Google Cloud.

We see continued growth with Q2 revenue of $8 billion, up 28%, and operating profit of $395 million. Our AI-optimized infrastructure is a leading platform for training and serving generative AI models. More than 70% of gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers, including Cohere, Jasper, Typeface and many more. We provide the widest choice of AI supercomputer options with Google TPUs and advanced NVIDIA GPUs, and recently launched new A3 AI supercomputers powered by NVIDIA’s H100. This enables customers like AppLovin to achieve nearly 2 times better price performance than industry alternatives. Our new generative AI offerings are expanding our total addressable market and winning new customers. We are seeing strong demand for the more than 80 models, including third-party and popular open source in our Vertex, Search and Conversational AI platforms with a number of customers growing more than 15x from April to June.""

Some of the best tech stocks to buy according to hedge funds include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).  20 Worst Performing Economies in 2023

20 Worst Performing Economies in 2023

Our Methodology:

To find data for the 20 worst performing economies in 2023, our focus was on the economies with the lowest real GDP growth rate with annual percentage change. The real GDP growth rate reflects the economic growth of an economy expressing its GDP from one period to the next. We ranked the list from the IMF's database which tracks the real GDP growth rate. The economies with the same real GDP growth rate are differentiated based on their GDP at current prices, which was taken from the IMF's database of GDP at current prices. The country with lower GDP at current prices is ranked higher and so on. The list may not include countries such as Western Sahara, Syria, and Lebanon as their data is not available. The lists are then ranked in descending order of the aforementioned metric. Here are the 20 worst performing economies in 2023.

Global Economic Outlook

The global economy is facing a transition from the massive economic downfall during the pandemic and Russia’s war against Ukraine. The global economy was negatively impacted by the supply chain issues following the lockdown during the pandemic. However, supply chain disruptions are shrinking and businesses are improving around the world. At the same time, the monetary policies of central banks should begin to produce the outcomes, with the inflation rate expected to move back toward its target. In 2023, the global economy is expected to slowly get back on track.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its July 2023 World Economic Outlook highlights that global growth will drop to 3% in both 2023 and 2024, falling from an estimated 3.5% in 2022. Global inflation will continue to decrease but at a much slower rate than initially anticipated, from 8.7% in 2022 to 6.8% in 2023. The core inflation is expected to remain moderate, and inflation forecast for 2024 has been revised upward. The main cause behind this was the COVID-19 pandemic and trade tensions after the Russia-Ukraine war. During the press briefing of the July 2023 World Economic Outlook, the following comments were made regarding economic development:

""The global economy continues to gradually recover from the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but it is not yet out of the woods. The COVID-19 health crisis is officially over, supply chain disruptions have returned to pre-pandemic levels, economic activity in the first quarter of the year proved resilient, and labor markets are quite tight in many places. Energy and food prices have come down faster than expected from the war-induced peaks. And financial instability following the March banking turmoil remains contained thanks to forceful actions by the U.S. and Swiss authorities.

Stronger growth and lower inflation than expected are welcome news, suggesting the global economy is headed in the right direction. Yet growth remains low by historical standards, and while some adverse risks have moderated, the balance remains tilted to the downside, and it is too early to celebrate. There are growing signs that global activity is losing momentum. The global tightening of monetary policy has brought interest rates into contractionary territory. This has started to weigh down on activity, slowing the growth of credit to the nonfinancial sector, increasing households' and firms' interest payments, and putting pressure on real estate markets.

Second core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, remains well above central bank targets, and is expected to decline only gradually. In advanced economies, core inflation is expected to remain unchanged at 5.1 percent this year before declining to 3.1 percent in 2024. Clearly, the battle against inflation is not yet won.

Key to inflation's persistence will be labor market developments and wage profit dynamics. Despite tight labor markets, overall wage inflation has increased, but remains behind price inflation in most countries. The reason is simple and has little to do with so called greedflation. Prices adjust upwards faster than wages when nominal demand far exceeds what the economy can produce. As a result, real wages have declined. If labor markets remain strong, we should expect and welcome real wages recovering lost ground. Indeed the gap between nominal wage growth and price inflation has started to close. Because firms' profit margins have grown robustly in the last two years, we remain confident that there is room to accommodate the rebound in real wages without triggering a wage price spiral. With inflation expectations well-anchored in major economies and the economy slowing, market pressures should help contain the passthrough from labor cost to prices.""

Story continues

In the medium term, overall economic growth is expected to slow down. Especially, developed economies are expected to face a slowdown in their economy, as the growth is expected to fall from 2.7% in 2022 to 1.5% in 2023. In comparison, the growth in developing economies and emerging markets is expected to remain stable at 4% in 2023 and 4.1% in 2024. According to the World Economic Forum’s Chief Economists' Outlook, the global economy seems gloomy. The majority of chief economists project moderate or strong growth in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia. Some of the most important economies in the world from the following regions include Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, India, and Japan.

How are Businesses Recovering?

After a long halt during the pandemic, companies from different sectors are making strong progress. Most importantly, it depends on the sector in which a company is operating. Some sectors have performed exceptionally well while some have been struggling. So far in 2023, the worst performing sectors have been healthcare, energy, and utilities. For instance, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) shares have plunged almost 30% since the start of the year, as of July 31. Whereas, consumer discretionary and technology have outperformed other sectors in the market. As we mentioned earlier, the tech sector is having a great time this year. Most investors are betting on tech stocks regardless of high inflation concerns. One of the main reasons why the tech sector has skyrocketed is the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) hype. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google is making massive progress in AI as the customers are highly interested in its cloud services. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai believes that in the long-term, AI will potentially expand Google's total addressable market and allow them to win new customers. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has some big tech competitors in AI including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

On July 28, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) released its earnings for the second quarter of 2023. The company posted earnings per share of $1.44, beating the expectations of $0.10. The company posted revenue of $74.60 billion and surpassed the consensus by $1.85 billion. Google continues to progress with its cloud business and advance in AI. With so much hope around Google's AI technology and future AI plans, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has soared 10% this week. During the Q2 2023 earnings call, the company made the following comments:

""The momentum across the Company drove our results this quarter. We delivered solid performance in Search and YouTube and ongoing strong growth in Cloud, where we remain focused on long-term value creation. And we continue our important work to operate more efficiently, creating durable savings to fund investments in our biggest priorities.

I’ll talk about this momentum, including our continued leadership in AI and our excitement about the evolution of Search. At I/O, we shared how we are making AI helpful for everyone in four important ways: first, improving knowledge and learning. This is our seventh year as an AI-first company, and we intuitively know how to incorporate AI into our products. Large language models make them even more helpful, models like PaLM 2 and soon Gemini, which we are building to be multimodal. These advances provide an opportunity to reimagine many of our products, including our most important product, Search. We are in a period of incredible innovation for Search, which has continuously evolved over the years. This quarter saw our next major evolution with the launch of the Search Generative Experience, or SGE, which uses the power of generative AI to make search even more natural and intuitive.

User feedback has been very positive so far. It can better answer the queries people come to us with today, while also unlocking entirely new types of questions that Search can answer. For example, we found that generative AI can connect the dots for people as they explore a topic or project, helping them weigh multiple factors and personal preferences before making a purchase or booking a trip. We see this new experience as another jumping off point for exploring the web, enabling users to go deeper to learn about a topic. I’m proud of the engineering excellence underlying our progress. Since the May launch, we’ve boosted serving efficiency, reducing the time it takes to generate AI snapshots by half. We’ll deliver even faster responses over time.

We have made good progress in data center machine efficiency, which will pay dividends as we continue to invest in AI. We continue to slow our expense growth and pace of hiring and ensure our teams are aligned to our highest priorities. This quarter, we reallocated a number of teams, including aligning Waze’s ad sales with our existing business organization. We are combining various engineering efforts across core infrastructure and cloud. Products like Bard and SGE are being built by small fast-moving teams that have been reallocated to these high-priority efforts. Overall, we are actively moving people to higher priority activities within the Company, and we continue to optimize our real estate footprint for current and future needs. Next, Google Cloud.

We see continued growth with Q2 revenue of $8 billion, up 28%, and operating profit of $395 million. Our AI-optimized infrastructure is a leading platform for training and serving generative AI models. More than 70% of gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers, including Cohere, Jasper, Typeface and many more. We provide the widest choice of AI supercomputer options with Google TPUs and advanced NVIDIA GPUs, and recently launched new A3 AI supercomputers powered by NVIDIA’s H100. This enables customers like AppLovin to achieve nearly 2 times better price performance than industry alternatives. Our new generative AI offerings are expanding our total addressable market and winning new customers. We are seeing strong demand for the more than 80 models, including third-party and popular open source in our Vertex, Search and Conversational AI platforms with a number of customers growing more than 15x from April to June.""

Some of the best tech stocks to buy according to hedge funds include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).  20 Worst Performing Economies in 2023

20 Worst Performing Economies in 2023

Our Methodology:

To find data for the 20 worst performing economies in 2023, our focus was on the economies with the lowest real GDP growth rate with annual percentage change. The real GDP growth rate reflects the economic growth of an economy expressing its GDP from one period to the next. We ranked the list from the IMF's database which tracks the real GDP growth rate. The economies with the same real GDP growth rate are differentiated based on their GDP at current prices, which was taken from the IMF's database of GDP at current prices. The country with lower GDP at current prices is ranked higher and so on. The list may not include countries such as Western Sahara, Syria, and Lebanon as their data is not available. The lists are then ranked in descending order of the aforementioned metric. Here are the 20 worst performing economies in 2023.

21,2023-07-31T21:01:39+00:00,The 2023 stock market rally got a lot healthier in June and July,"July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.

But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.

And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.

This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.

Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notable, however, that Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years. S&P 500 Sectors Were All Green from June to July 2023

In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.

The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL) which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector, too.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.

And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)

Story continues

Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.

In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May. A sign hangs above the entrance of a Kohl's store on March 01, 2023 in Lincolnwood, Illinois. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)

Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.

The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.

Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.

3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).

Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.

Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%. Telecom company Verizon (VZ) and pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) are also toward the bottom.

23,2023-07-31T23:54:16+00:00,"Asian stocks push higher on tech strength, China lags","Investing.com -- Most Asian stocks rose on Tuesday, buoyed by strength in technology stocks as markets awaited major U.S. earnings this week, although Chinese markets lagged on more weak economic signals.

Regional markets took positive cues from a strong overnight finish on Wall Street, although focus remained chiefly on upcoming earnings reports from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). But strong results from tech heavyweights Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) last week set a positive tone for the upcoming earnings.

Optimism over improving global economic prospects - amid easing inflation and resilient growth in major economies - also spurred flows into risk-heavy stocks.

Tech-heavy indexes lead gains

South Korea’s KOSPI was the best performer for the day, up over 1% on strength in heavyweight chipmaking stocks. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930) rose 1.2% after U.S. memory chip making peer Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) said that the worst for the industry was over, even as the firm forecast a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss and revenue drop.

Strength in internet giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (HK:9988) (NYSE:BABA), Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), and Baidu Inc (HK:9888) (NASDAQ:BIDU) kept the Hang Seng index in positive territory, even as other sectors on the index logged steep losses. Property developer Country Garden (HK:2007) slid over 5% after it scrapped a $300 million capital raise.

The Taiwan Weighted index logged small gains, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.6% on strong automobile and tech stocks.

Sentiment towards Japanese stocks was also aided by emergency bond buying by the Bank of Japan, which pushed up bets that the bank was in no hurry to tighten policy immediately.

Futures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a flat open, although both indexes were close to hitting record highs on strength in heavyweight tech stocks.

Still, gains in most markets were limited as investors remained wary of key U.S. nonfarm payrolls data this week. Mixed economic cues from China also dented sentiment.

Australia’s ASX 200 rose 0.3% ahead of a closely-watched Reserve Bank decision later in the day. Markets are split over whether the bank will hike rates further.

Chinese stocks lag on weak PMIs, stimulus in focus

China’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 index rose just 0.1%, while the Shanghai Composite fell slightly as a private survey showed on Tuesday that the country’s manufacturing sector unexpectedly shrank in July.

The reading follows a dismal official survey for July, and shows that China’s biggest economic engines are seeing little signs of recovery this year.

The reading spurred more expectations of stimulus measures from the country, with officials promising more policies to boost domestic consumption and activity. But they have so far offered no clear specifics on the policies, which has left investors somewhat wary of local stocks.

While the prospect of more Chinese stimulus had spurred strong gains in local stocks over the past week, the momentum now appears to be slowing.

24,2023-07-31T21:01:39+00:00,The 2023 stock market rally got a lot healthier in June and July,"July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.

But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.

And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.

This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.

Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notable, however, that Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years. S&P 500 Sectors Were All Green from June to July 2023

In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.

The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL) which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector, too.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.

And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)

Story continues

Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.

In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May. A sign hangs above the entrance of a Kohl's store on March 01, 2023 in Lincolnwood, Illinois. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)

Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.

The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.

Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.

3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).

Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.

Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%. Telecom company Verizon (VZ) and pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) are also toward the bottom.

26,2023-07-31T23:54:16+00:00,"Asian stocks push higher on tech strength, China lags","Investing.com -- Most Asian stocks rose on Tuesday, buoyed by strength in technology stocks as markets awaited major U.S. earnings this week, although Chinese markets lagged on more weak economic signals.

Regional markets took positive cues from a strong overnight finish on Wall Street, although focus remained chiefly on upcoming earnings reports from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). But strong results from tech heavyweights Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) last week set a positive tone for the upcoming earnings.

Optimism over improving global economic prospects - amid easing inflation and resilient growth in major economies - also spurred flows into risk-heavy stocks.

Tech-heavy indexes lead gains

South Korea’s KOSPI was the best performer for the day, up over 1% on strength in heavyweight chipmaking stocks. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930) rose 1.2% after U.S. memory chip making peer Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) said that the worst for the industry was over, even as the firm forecast a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss and revenue drop.

Strength in internet giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (HK:9988) (NYSE:BABA), Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), and Baidu Inc (HK:9888) (NASDAQ:BIDU) kept the Hang Seng index in positive territory, even as other sectors on the index logged steep losses.

AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER

Preliminary, unaudited results Second Quarter ended June 30 Year-to-date ended June 30 2023 2022 Variance 2023 2022 Variance Revenue ($ in billions): 4.4 4.6 (0.2) 9.1 9.2 (0.1) Earnings ($ in millions): GAAP 521.2 524.5 (3.3) 918.2 1,239.2 (321.0) Operating (non-GAAP) 582.2 617.7 (35.5) 1,153.8 1,234.1 (80.3) EPS ($): GAAP 1.01 1.02 (0.01) 1.78 2.43 (0.65) Operating (non-GAAP) 1.13 1.20 (0.07) 2.24 2.42 (0.18) EPS based on 515 million shares 2Q 2023, 514 million shares 2Q 2022, 515 million shares YTD 2023 and 510 million shares YTD 2022.

American Electric Power (Nasdaq: AEP) today reported second-quarter 2023 earnings, prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), of $521 million or $1.01 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $525 million or $1.02 per share in second-quarter 2022. Operating earnings for second-quarter 2023 were $582 million or $1.13 per share, compared with operating earnings of $618 million or $1.20 per share in second-quarter 2022.

Operating earnings is a non-GAAP measure representing GAAP earnings excluding special items. The difference between 2023 GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter was largely due to the mark-to-market impact of economic hedging activities and recent legislation in Texas regarding recovery of certain employee incentives. A full reconciliation of GAAP earnings to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date is included in the tables at the end of this news release.

""AEP is committed to creating value for all our stakeholders as we invest $40 billion over the next five years in our energy delivery system and new generation resources. We made significant progress on our strategic objectives in the second quarter, executing on our regulated renewables and grid investment plans to benefit customers while working to keep rates affordable and supporting economic growth in our communities,"" said Julie Sloat, AEP president and chief executive officer.

""This quarter's results reflect the timing of higher interest and O&M expenses, as well as milder temperatures year over year. Our projections for the second half of the year are bolstered by our focus on cost discipline, efficiency and agility in operations to ensure we meet our stakeholder commitments. We are reaffirming our 2023 operating earnings guidance range of $5.19 to $5.39 per share and our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%.

""Residential and industrial load have slowed down as expected due to the impacts of inflation and rising interest rates on our customers. At the same time, we've had a significant increase in commercial load, which has grown almost 8 percent year over year in each of the last two quarters. This improvement is largely driven by our ongoing focus on economic development to bring growth and opportunity to our communities,"" Sloat said.

""We continue taking actions to de-risk and simplify our business. We expect to close on the sale of our 1,365-megawatt unregulated renewables portfolio to IRG Acquisition Holdings in August 2023 and are on track with the sales processes for the AEP Energy retail and AEP OnSite Partners distributed resources businesses as well as our 50% share in the New Mexico Renewable Development joint venture.

""We announced today that we'll be launching the sale of AEP's interests in two non-core transmission joint ventures, Prairie Wind and Pioneer. We plan to complete the previously announced strategic review of our Transource Energy joint venture by the end of the year. Our ongoing active management of the company strengthens our ability to prioritize investments in our regulated businesses to enhance service for customers while maintaining our commitment to credit quality,"" Sloat said.

""In the second quarter, we received regulatory approval to add nearly 2,000 megawatts of new wind and solar generation to help meet the projected power needs of customers in Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. We now have approvals in place for $5.2 billion of our five-year, $8.6 billion regulated renewables capital plan. We've filed for approval of $1.7 billion in additional renewable projects and have active RFPs for resources in other jurisdictions. We also continue to see positive earnings contributions from the transmission investments we're making to improve reliability and service for our customers,"" Sloat said.

EARNINGS GUIDANCE

AEP management reaffirmed its 2023 operating earnings guidance range of $5.19 to $5.39 per share. Operating earnings could differ from GAAP earnings for matters such as impairments, divestitures or changes in accounting principles. AEP management is not able to forecast if any of these items will occur or any amounts that may be reported for future periods. Therefore, AEP is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for earnings guidance.

Reflecting special items recorded through the second quarter, the estimated earnings per share on a GAAP basis would be $4.73 to $4.93 per share. See the table below for a full reconciliation of 2023 earnings guidance.

The company uses operating earnings data internally to measure performance against budget, to report to AEP's Board of Directors and also as an input in determining performance-based compensation under the company's employee incentive compensation plans.

30,2023-07-28T12:00:46+00:00,Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) Seems To Use Debt Quite Sensibly,"Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) does use debt in its business. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.

When Is Debt Dangerous?

Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.

Check out our latest analysis for Amgen

What Is Amgen's Net Debt?

As you can see below, at the end of March 2023, Amgen had US$61.6b of debt, up from US$36.9b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. On the flip side, it has US$31.6b in cash leading to net debt of about US$30.0b. debt-equity-history-analysis

A Look At Amgen's Liabilities

The latest balance sheet data shows that Amgen had liabilities of US$14.2b due within a year, and liabilities of US$69.2b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$31.6b and US$5.74b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$46.1b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.

This deficit isn't so bad because Amgen is worth a massive US$125.7b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.

Story continues

We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.

Amgen has net debt worth 2.3 times EBITDA, which isn't too much, but its interest cover looks a bit on the low side, with EBIT at only 5.8 times the interest expense. While that doesn't worry us too much, it does suggest the interest payments are somewhat of a burden. Importantly Amgen's EBIT was essentially flat over the last twelve months. Ideally it can diminish its debt load by kick-starting earnings growth. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Amgen's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this freereport showing analyst profit forecasts.

But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the last three years, Amgen recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 91% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.

Our View

On our analysis Amgen's conversion of EBIT to free cash flow should signal that it won't have too much trouble with its debt. But the other factors we noted above weren't so encouraging. For instance it seems like it has to struggle a bit handle its debt, based on its EBITDA,. When we consider all the elements mentioned above, it seems to us that Amgen is managing its debt quite well. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Amgen is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about...

31,2023-07-31T15:09:00+00:00,Amgen (AMGN) to Report Q2 Earnings: Here's What to Expect,"Amgen AMGN will report second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 3, after market close. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 3.65%.

Factors to Consider

Amgen’s product sales are expected to have risen as prescription trends and demand for most of its medicines are expected to have improved to pre-pandemic levels despite the current macroeconomic challenges.

In the second quarter, volume growth from Amgen’s key drugs like Evenity, Repatha and Prolia is expected to have driven top-line growth.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Prolia, Repatha, and Evenity sales are pegged at $974 million, $382 million and $262.0 million, respectively.

Our estimates for Prolia, Repatha and Evenity sales are pegged at $962.6 million, $366.2 million, and $242.5 million, respectively.

In addition, newer drugs like Tezspire and Tavneos are expected to have contributed to top-line growth.

Like the first quarter of 2023, sales of Otezla in the United States are expected to have been hurt by free drug programs launched by new competitors. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Otezla is $587.0 million, while our estimate is $590.3 million.

Also, increasing branded and generic competition for its legacy products like Enbrel, Aranesp, Epogen, Neupogen, Neulasta and Sensipar are likely to have hurt the top line.

Regarding Enbrel, Amgen expects low single-digit volume growth. The decline in prices is expected to have reduced in the second quarter, while inventory levels are expected to have recovered from first-quarter levels. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Enbrel is $868.0 million, while our estimate is $797.3 million.

Also, pricing pressure and increased competition are likely to have continued to hurt sales of some drugs as well as biosimilar products like Kanjinti and Mvasi. Sales of relatively newer medicine, Lumakras, may have declined sequentially, due to lower net selling price. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lumakras/Lumykras is $88.0 million, while our estimate is $89.0 million.

Second-quarter sales of Amjevita, Amgen’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s ABBV drug Humira, are expected to have been lower than first-quarter sales of $164 million. This is because most of U.S. Amjevita sales in the first quarter stemmed from inventory build. Amgen launched Amjevita in the United States at a 55% lower list price than the current price set by AbbVie for Humira in February. Amgen already markets a biosimilar of AbbVie’s Humira, Amgevita, in the United States.

Update on Horizon Therapeutics’ Acquisition

In May, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) filed a lawsuit in Federal Court to halt Amgen's proposed $28 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics HZNP.

Per the FTC, if the acquisition is allowed to go through, a large-cap giant like Amgen could leverage its position with insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers to entrench the monopoly positions for two of Horizon's key products — Tepezza (approved for treating thyroid eye disease) and Krystexxa (approved for treating chronic refractory gout). Per the agency, the drugs currently face little to no competition in the market and are sold at very high prices to patients.

Earnings Surprise History

This large biotech’s performance has been strong, with earnings beating estimates in all the trailing four quarters. The company delivered a four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.17%, on average.

Earnings Whispers

Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Amgen this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here.

Earnings ESP: Amgen’s Earnings ESP -1.41% as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.44 per share is higher than the Most Accurate Estimate of $4.37 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

Zacks Rank: Amgen has a Zacks Rank #3.

Stock to Consider

A large drug stock that has the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around is Novo Nordisk NVO. It has an Earnings ESP of +4.63% and a Zacks Rank #3.

Novo Nordisk’s stock has risen 16.6% so far this year. Novo Nordisk topped earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters while missing in one. It has a four-quarter earnings surprise of 0.35%, on average. NVO is scheduled to release its second-quarter results on Aug 10.

34,2023-07-27T20:48:00+00:00,Should Investors Buy These 3 Top-Ranked Tech Stocks?,"Technology stocks have been big-time performers year-to-date, rewarding investors with gains following a dreadful 2022. Take, for example, the Zacks Computer & Technology sector, which is up 41% in 2023 compared to the S&P 500’s impressive 21% gain. Zacks Investment Research

And for those interested in further exposure to the sector, three stocks – StoneCo STNE, Analog Devices ADI, and nVent Electric NVT – would all provide precisely that.

All three are forecasted to witness solid earnings growth, have seen their earnings outlooks improve over the last several months, and carry sound valuations. Let’s take a closer look at each.

StoneCo

StoneCo offers an end-to-end cloud-based technology platform to conduct electronic commerce across in-store, online, and mobile channels. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with earnings expectations drifting higher.

As shown below, the revisions trend has been robust across multiple timeframes. Zacks Investment Research

In addition, the company’s valuation is attractive, with the current 18.9X forward earnings multiple sitting nowhere near the steep 45.5X five-year median and highs of 66.9X in 2022. The stock carries a Style Score of “B” for Value. Zacks Investment Research

And it’s impossible to ignore the company’s growth expectations, with earnings forecasted to soar 115% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 20% in FY24. Top-line growth is also apparent, with sales suggested to climb 4.4% and 8% in FY23 and FY24, respectively.

Analog Devices

Analog Devices, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices. The revisions trend has been notably bullish for its current fiscal year, with the $10.57 per share estimate up nearly 7% since July 2022. Zacks Investment Research

Shares aren’t stretched regarding valuation, with the current 18.1X forward earnings multiple well beneath the 21.1X five-year median and steep highs of 23.5X in 2022. The stock sports a Style Score of “C” for Value. Zacks Investment Research

The company has been a consistent earnings performer, exceeding both earnings and revenue estimates in 12 consecutive quarters. ADI posted a 3% EPS beat in its latest release and reported revenue nearly 2% ahead of expectations.

nVent Electric

nVent Electric, a current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), provides electrical connection and protection solutions. Analysts have been bullish across all timeframes over the last several months. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

NVT shares provide exposure to technology paired with a passive income stream; NVT’s annual dividend currently yields 1.3%, with a payout ratio sitting sustainably at 27% of the company’s earnings. The payout hasn’t grown in the last five years, but NVT’s 125% share gain during the period certainly picks up the slack.

Keep an eye out for the company’s upcoming quarterly release expected on July 28th; the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.68 indicates a solid 20% improvement in earnings from the year-ago quarter. In addition, nVent Electric is expected to post $787 in quarterly revenue, 8% higher year-over-year. Zacks Investment Research

Bottom Line

With the strong performance of technology stocks in 2023, investors have been scurrying to find exposure if they didn’t already have it.

And for those interested in riding the sector’s current momentum, all three stocks above – StoneCo STNE, Analog Devices ADI, and nVent Electric NVT – would be worth a close look.

All three sport solid growth, an improved earnings outlook, and sound valuations.

Unlike traditional computers that use bits, quantum computers use qubits that can solve complex problems faster and more efficiently. In other words, these computers could revolutionize many industries. And we’re just at the beginning of this technological advancement. In this article, we’ll uncover the best quantum computing stocks to buy, highlighting highlight three hidden gems making incredible progress in this groundbreaking field.

Each of these companies offers a unique and valuable proposition, showcasing innovative approaches to the challenges and possibilities of quantum computing.

So, here are the best quantum computing stocks to add to your portfolio.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

IonQ (IONQ) A concept image of a processor representing quantum computing. IONQ Stock

IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) is one of the best quantum computing stocks for investors. The company’s technology allows its computers to perform longer, more complex calculations with fewer errors than any quantum computer yet built. That makes IonQ a speculative investment with significant growth potential.

There’s a good reason to feel bullish on IONQ. The company recently entered into a significant partnership with QuantumBasel, Switzerland’s first quantum hub. The collaboration aims to establish a European quantum data center and includes the installation of two advanced IonQ quantum computers at QuantumBasel. The partnership is reportedly backed with over $500 million in private funding. That may help put IonQ on the map and give it a leg up over competitors.

For momentum investors, there’s good reason to consider this stock too. It’s up 418% year to date. Its EPS is also forecasted to grow 20% over the next five years.

Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) is a leading semiconductor company whose processing chips are vital to today’s digital economy. As quantum computing grows, related suppliers like semiconductors are expected to become increasingly important.

Story continues

As a mid-cap ($99.49 billion) stock, Analog Devices offers great growth potential. The brand beat revenue and earnings estimates last quarter. Sales grew 10% year-over-year, while earnings surged 18%. Sales were $3.26 billion, and adjusted earnings were $2.83 per share.

Wall Street gave ADI stock a $207.83 price target. I think this target is feasible. The market has resumed its risk appetite for tech stocks, and speculative plays like ADI stock have come back into fashion. Its share also trades just below its 52-week high, and judging by its momentum indicators, it will breach this resistance zone shortly.

Rigetti Computing (RGTI) An image of a computer chip on a motherboard; quantum computing

Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ:RGTI) is a full-stack quantum computing company that designs quantum chips, integrates those chips with a controlling architecture and develops software. This quantum computing stock should definitely be on your radar.

Rigetti’s competitive advantage lies in its focus on hybrid quantum-classical computing systems. In short, it wants to give consumers the best of both worlds. It aims to accomplish this through the release of its Ankaa-1 84-qubit system. Once it has built significant traction with its release, it will attempt to capture a quantum advantage over its competitors.

The company also recently entered into a collaboration agreement with ADIA Lab, an independent research institute based in Abu Dhabi specializing in data and computational sciences. The partnership aims to design, build, execute and optimize a quantum computing solution.

36,2023-07-31T21:01:39+00:00,The 2023 stock market rally got a lot healthier in June and July,"July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.

But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.

And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.

This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.

Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notable, however, that Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years. S&P 500 Sectors Were All Green from June to July 2023

In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.

The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL) which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector, too.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.

And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)

Story continues

Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.

In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May. A sign hangs above the entrance of a Kohl's store on March 01, 2023 in Lincolnwood, Illinois. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)

Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.

The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.

Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.

3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).

Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.

Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%. Telecom company Verizon (VZ) and pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) are also toward the bottom.

38,2023-07-31T23:54:16+00:00,"Asian stocks push higher on tech strength, China lags","Investing.com -- Most Asian stocks rose on Tuesday, buoyed by strength in technology stocks as markets awaited major U.S. earnings this week, although Chinese markets lagged on more weak economic signals.

Regional markets took positive cues from a strong overnight finish on Wall Street, although focus remained chiefly on upcoming earnings reports from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). But strong results from tech heavyweights Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) last week set a positive tone for the upcoming earnings.

Optimism over improving global economic prospects - amid easing inflation and resilient growth in major economies - also spurred flows into risk-heavy stocks.

Tech-heavy indexes lead gains

South Korea’s KOSPI was the best performer for the day, up over 1% on strength in heavyweight chipmaking stocks. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930) rose 1.2% after U.S. memory chip making peer Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) said that the worst for the industry was over, even as the firm forecast a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss and revenue drop.

Strength in internet giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (HK:9988) (NYSE:BABA), Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), and Baidu Inc (HK:9888) (NASDAQ:BIDU) kept the Hang Seng index in positive territory, even as other sectors on the index logged steep losses. Property developer Country Garden (HK:2007) slid over 5% after it scrapped a $300 million capital raise.

The Taiwan Weighted index logged small gains, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.6% on strong automobile and tech stocks.

Sentiment towards Japanese stocks was also aided by emergency bond buying by the Bank of Japan, which pushed up bets that the bank was in no hurry to tighten policy immediately.

Futures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a flat open, although both indexes were close to hitting record highs on strength in heavyweight tech stocks.

Story continues

Still, gains in most markets were limited as investors remained wary of key U.S. nonfarm payrolls data this week. Mixed economic cues from China also dented sentiment.

Australia’s ASX 200 rose 0.3% ahead of a closely-watched Reserve Bank decision later in the day. Markets are split over whether the bank will hike rates further.

Chinese stocks lag on weak PMIs, stimulus in focus

China’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 index rose just 0.1%, while the Shanghai Composite fell slightly as a private survey showed on Tuesday that the country’s manufacturing sector unexpectedly shrank in July.

The reading follows a dismal official survey for July, and shows that China’s biggest economic engines are seeing little signs of recovery this year.

The reading spurred more expectations of stimulus measures from the country, with officials promising more policies to boost domestic consumption and activity. But they have so far offered no clear specifics on the policies, which has left investors somewhat wary of local stocks.

While the prospect of more Chinese stimulus had spurred strong gains in local stocks over the past week, the momentum now appears to be slowing.

39,2023-07-27T23:00:00+00:00,Is This The Best Way To Play The $700 Billion EV Boom?,"Electric vehicle sales are set for a 35% year-on-year increase in 2023, with national policies and incentives providing further impetus for producers and consumers. So far, overall, this has been rewarding for investors.

While the top 14 EV stocks had a market capitalization representing only 13% of that of the Top 10 vehicle manufacturers as of the end of 2019, they still managed to outperform them. That trend continued through last year, both with EV and battery stocks.

Electric car sales exceeded 10 million units in 2022, with their market share steadily climbing, from less than 5% of new cars sold in 2020 to 14% in 2022. In the first quarter of this year, we already saw a 25% jump in sales, year-on-year.

But this space has become extremely crowded, resulting in a price war that is making investors uneasy.

It’s time to find a new niche in the EV segment where first-movers have a very clear advantage: electric boating, where innovators hope to take the EV revolution off-road.

The waterways are going electric, too.

That’s why the next big thing in racing is all-electric, with NFL superstar Tom Brady joining the UIM E1 World Championship with ownership of an electric boat racing team. The inaugural season of the EV boating world championship is set to launch in early 2024.

The electric boat playing field is far less chaotic and crowded, and the first-mover advantage goes to Vision Marine Technologies (NASDAQ:VMAR), which offers a proprietary PowerTrain outboard motor that is being used in the launch of the fastest electric speedboat in its class on the market.

The newly unveiled H2e Bowrider speed boat took the Paris Boat Show by storm in December, and made its official debut in February in Miami, with deliveries expected to start this summer.

The boat, developed in partnership with Four Winns, is special because it showcases VMAR’s E- Motion 180 HP electric outboard motor.

That motor, with proprietary PowerTrain technology, makes the H2e Bowrider the first all-electric series production bowrider on the market.

Story continues

The company is expecting first revenues from PowerTrain this year and is aggressively pursuing an electric disruption to the boat rental market, with franchise plans well underway. While it’s been all about build-out and launch over the past couple of years, VMAR is positioned to be free-cash-flow positive next year, and it’s not burning cash like its road warrior brethren.

The Sound of Silence Opportunity

The global electric boat market was valued at $5 billion in 2021, and is projected to reach $16.6 billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 12.9% from 2022 to 2031.

Narrowing that down by type, the 40-foot electric boat market alone is worth $1.9 billion as of 2023, and is set to hit $4.93 billion by 2030 for a growth rate of 14.6% during that time period.

As we speak, the multi-billion-dollar boat battery market is undergoing its biggest transition since the invention of the boat motor itself. Not only is the marine battery market forecast to grow by 18.6% to 2030, but it represents a $2-billion opportunity for investors over the next five years.

And while climate change is a key element propping up the electric boating industry, it’s not the only ‘attraction’:

Electric boats are quiet. They completely change the boating aesthetic by removing the sound of the loud outdoor motor, which overwhelms all other sound at sea. They’re safe, too.  There’s no risk of gasoline leaks or carbon monoxide poisoning common with internal combustion engines. The consensus seems to be that electric boat motors, by design, are more robust than their loud and dirty predecessors, and they also require a lot less frequent maintenance than a gasoline engine. They’re cheaper to operate over the long-run: No oil changes, no filters or tune-ups, and while combustion engines require maintenance every 100 hours, electric motors (on average) can go up to 3,000 hours

The World’s Most Powerful Electric PowerTrain

Vision Marine’s E-Motion is the first fully electric, production-ready, high-performance 180 HP outboard motor on the market.

The 180E Electric Powertrain can provide a consistent 180 HP of pure electric power, with cutting-edge high voltage power when you need it most, and a completely scalable powerbank.

The proprietary technology is end-to-end: It includes the batteries, the engine and the software, making it the only turn-key solution for boat manufacturers in its class.

The E-Motion outboard motor can fully charge overnight with no additional infrastructure and boasts the highest horsepower engine in its class. And from a cost perspective, it out-competes everyone else, which should help it to capture new market share.

Vision Marine’s (NASDAQ:VMAR),  E-Motion motor isn’t confined to speedboats, either; they’re turning pontoon boats into faster, better and cleaner versions of themselves.

VMAR is in the process of equipping a pontoon with electric propulsion and solar panels for the longest known electric boat run in America (and possibly in the world). VMAR’s Zenith pontoon will set off in Virginia on a 1,050-nautical-mile journey to Miami, Florida, to showcase the capabilities of sustainable electric power.

How they plan to market the E-Motion Powertrain is the part that should sound more attractive to investors who may or may not have been taken for a wild ride with EV investments. VMAR isn’t trying to manufacturer its own boats, which would mean burning through cash at an untenable rate (just like all the smaller EV companies right now). Instead, it’s marketing E-Motion to OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), and they’ve already received an impressive volume of orders.

Last September, right out of the gate, VMAR received and initial purchase order from the North America’s Limestone Boat Company for $2 million worth (25 units) of E-Motion 180E outboard motors and Powertrain systems. Limestone is now moving into scheduled production, with delivery target to dealers set to begin in 2024.

But the bigger picture is this: VMAR’s proprietary electric motor and powertrain system turns any boat into an electric boat, which makes its strategy to sell motors (not boats) to OEMs an incredibly savvy one in a market flooded with EV makers who are spending more money than they might ever make.

A Second, Disruptive Revenue Chain

VMAR also plans to plug in the boat rental market.

The global boat rental market (across all boat types) was valued at $18.2 billion in 2021, and is projected to reach $31.2 billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 5.7% from 2022 to 2031. It’s a huge market that is about to go electric.

And, again, VMAR has first-mover advantage.

VMAR’s flagship Newport business managed to serve 300,000 clients in the first three years, annualizing $4 million in revenues with a 35% profit margin.

For 2023, Vision Marine will be rolling out two more fully-owned electric boat rental locations and launching their franchise model.

By 2024, it’s expected to be full speed ahead with scaling.

The company’s proprietary technology gives it the opportunity to become one of the NASDAQ’s most exciting EV plays.

By the end of 2024, Vision Marine (NASDAQ:VMAR),  expects to be free-cash-flow positive, and by 2025, it expects to have two profitable and growing divisions, after which the scaling is expected to gain further momentum.

Other companies to keep an eye on:

With a dominant 92.8% share of the search market and a growing presence in the cloud market through Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Alphabet demonstrates its strong position. The company's diverse revenue streams, including digital advertising, cloud infrastructure, and streaming services, provide a solid foundation for future growth.

Additionally, Alphabet's commitment to innovation, integrating AI into various products and ventures like Waymo's autonomous driving, keeps the company at the forefront of technological advancements. Trading at approximately 17 times projected earnings in 2024 and with a projected annual increase of over 16% in per-share profits over the next five years, Alphabet offers an attractive investment opportunity for those seeking long-term growth prospects.

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), with a market capitalization of $2.8 trillion, stands as one of the most significant tech giants. The company's services segment, including Apple Music, Apple Pay, and Apple TV+, has witnessed remarkable growth and contributes to both financials and customer loyalty. Seamless integration between Apple's hardware and software ecosystem, combined with a vast user base of over 2 billion active Apple devices, fosters strong customer stickiness.

Apple's pricing power is evident, as it successfully raises prices for flagship products like the iPhone without significant demand impact. The company generates substantial free cash flow, enabling it to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. With proven resilience and a history of sustained growth, Apple remains an appealing choice for investors looking for a compelling long-term holding in the tech industry.

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) continues to dominate the e-commerce space with a commanding 38% share of online retail shopping in the U.S. The company's logistics and distribution capabilities further solidify its position as an industry leader. Additionally, Amazon's cloud infrastructure arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), holds a substantial 32% share of the cloud market, benefitting from the growing demand for on-demand cloud services. AWS's impressive operating margin of 28% contributes significantly to Amazon's overall profitability. The company's digital advertising business is also thriving, with a 23% increase in sales in the first quarter, making Amazon a strong player in the advertising space. With strategic investments in AI, exemplified by the launch of Bedrock within AWS, Amazon is well-prepared to leverage emerging technologies and maintain its market dominance. Trading at an attractive valuation and with multiple growth drivers, Amazon presents an enticing opportunity for investors looking for a market leader with a focus on AI initiatives.

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), formerly known as Facebook, has witnessed soaring stock prices, gaining nearly 120% in 2023. Despite already being a dominant player, the company continues to experience impressive growth, with 3.81 billion monthly active users across its Family of Apps. Meta's potential to monetize users outside the U.S. and Canada provides room for further revenue expansion. Reports suggest the company may be developing a decentralized alternative to Twitter, showcasing its commitment to innovation. Moreover, Meta's strong focus on leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance content recommendations and boost monetization positions it well for upcoming technological shifts. With a solid financial position, maintaining an average operating margin of 36.2% over the past five years and generating substantial free cash flow, Meta has the resources to drive further growth. These factors make Meta an appealing option for investors seeking a strong and forward-looking player in the social media and AI landscape.

Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Applied Materials' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 49% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Recent sales by insiders

A look at the shareholders of Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 83% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).

And things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$13b in market cap last week. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 45%.

Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Applied Materials.

View our latest analysis for Applied Materials  ownership-breakdown

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Applied Materials?

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

Applied Materials already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Applied Materials' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth

Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Applied Materials. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.7% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.3% and 7.3%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.

Story continues

Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

Insider Ownership Of Applied Materials

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.

Our information suggests that Applied Materials, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$445m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 17% stake in Applied Materials. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.

Next Steps:

I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that  Applied Materials is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about...

Story continues

As a reminder, to ask a question, please use the raise a hand function in Zoom or alternatively, you can click the Q&A button then write your questions. With that, Pascal, I will hand the call over to you.

Pascal Soriot: Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome. Please move on to the next slide. Total revenue in the first half of the year increased 4% to $22.3 billion, with 16% growth in our non-core medicines, offsetting a $2.2 billion decline in our COVID-19 medicines revenue. Core earnings per share increased 21% to $4.04. This increase reflects both our robust business performance, as well as a gain following an update to our contractor relationships for before in the US. We continue to benefit from our diverse commercial portfolio and our global footprint. Given our strong execution in the first half, we remain confident in our outlook for the remainder of the year, and we have reiterated our 2023 guidance. Next slide, please.

Taking a closer look at the performance of our non-COVID business across our regions in these areas, growth in the emerging markets continue to be strong. In particular, outside of China, emerging markets outside of China collectively grew by 38% in the first half. This growth underscores our confidence that these markets will become increasingly important to our business. We also saw double-digit growth across the EU and Europe in the period. On the right-hand side, you will see that we delivered a robust double-digit growth across oncology, severe RNI and rare disease. And as expected, we saw declines in B&I. This growth reflects strong medicines performance across these areas. Please advance to the next slide. When we look at performance across our portfolio in the first half, we had eight medicines deliver over $1 billion H1 product sales.

A broad range of these products are driving our growth, as you can see from this slide. For effective life cycle management, we've seen an acceleration in the rate of growth for several medicines, such as Imfinzi and Farxiga with new indications making important contributions to revenues. Ultomiris growth stood at, once again, and is the result of both successful conversion from Soliris as well as growth in patient numbers. We've also seen promising global growth from some of our more recently launched medicines including an HER2, Calquence, Breast03, Troponin and Saphnelo, all of which are helping to change the course of their respective diseases. Next slide, please. Confidence in our long-term outlook is supported by our robust let stage pipeline, which now has well over 120 active projects.

Importantly, we maintain a rigorous approach to R&D development. Setting a high bar for late-stage trial initiations and advancing only the most promising projects. We strive to stay at the front of the innovation curve and we have already progressed 14 new molecular entities into lettuce development. We're making good progress towards initiating 30 new pivotal trials this year, having those nine in the year-to-date with recent additions, including the lithos trial for Breast03 asthma and two next-generation propane trials, which will support the expansion of our PMDI portfolio. As we indicated last quarter, most of the new pivotal trials are expected to dose in the second half of this year. Our pipeline continues to make exciting progress with eight positive pivotal oncology trials already this year.

These are shown on the right-hand side of this slide. In particular, we are encouraged by the positive results from the TROPION-Lung01 trial of Dato-DXd and are excited to unlock the full potential of this promising medicine. On the next slide, Aradhana can take you through our financial highlights in the first half as well as provide some further insights into how we are embracing the power of artificial intelligence across our manufacturing and supply chain. Over to you, Aradhana.

Aradhana Sarin: Thank you, Pascal, and good afternoon, everyone. As usual, I'll start with our reported P&L. Please advance to the next slide. As Pascal mentioned, total revenue increased by 4% to $2.3 billion in the first half. Total revenue, excluding COVID-19 medicines, increased 16%. Alliance revenue of $627 million includes $475 million of an HER2 profit sharing from geographies where Daiichi Sankyo books product sales. Collaboration revenue of $220 million includes $180 million license fee from Serum Institute of India booked in the second quarter relating to our COVD-19 and anti-body license agreement. Please advance to the next slide, which shows our core P&L. The core product sales gross margin in the first half was 82.9%, benefiting from lower production costs in prior quarters, and certain non-recurring items in the first quarter.

As previously communicated, we expect the product sales gross margin in the second half to be negatively impacted, similar to in prior years, by seasonality for Flumis and certain other medicines, the mandatory price reduction for Tagrisso in Japan, as well as the full impact of inflation. We still expect the product sales gross margin on a full year basis to be slightly higher than pre-COVID-19 levels. Looking ahead beyond 2023, we expect product sales gross margin percentage will be negatively impacted by profit sharing arrangements. While we already see this dynamic with Lynparza, we anticipate the impact to increase as we start seeing higher sales from medicines such as HER2 and Tezspire in regions where we book product sales and then pay out a portion of profits to our partners through cost of sales.

Over the long-term, we're focusing on driving productivity improvements to counter the impact on our gross margin from inflation, continued growth in emerging markets and more complex and expensive manufacturing of new modalities we're investing in. Core operating expenses in the half increased by 8%, R&D costs increased by 9%, driven by continued investments in our pipeline. The increase in SG&A costs partly reflects spend behind new launches such as TOPAZ and HIMALAYA, which are driving the strong growth of Imfinzi and DUO, for example, as well as existing brands like Farxiga and Breast03 and geographic expansion of the rare disease medicines portfolio. We previously guided for total core operating expenses to increase by low to mid-single-digit percentage in 2023, and we now expect to finish the year towards the upper end of this range.

Similar to the phasing we observed in 2022, we expect R&D and SG&A spend to be weighted towards the second half. Other operating income of $1.1 billion includes $712 million related to the previously announced updated agreements on the Beyfortus, which was booked in the second quarter. The increase in other operating income is in line with the guidance set out at the start of the year where we said that other operating income would be higher versus last year. The tax rate in the second quarter was lower than full year guidance due to certain tax incentives and mix of profits and lower tax legal entities. For the full year, we continue to expect this core tax rate will be between 8% and 22%. Core EPS of $4.07 in the first half, represents an increase of 21% at constant exchange rates.

Next slide, please. Our net cash inflow from operating activities increased by $400 million to $4.9 billion, and we continue to see improvement in our cash conversion. Net debt increased by $1 billion to $24 billion, driven by the payment of the second interim dividend in March and $2.4 billion in deal payments, which include the second payment to Acerta made in the first quarter. As a reminder, we will pay the third and final payment in 2024. For the full year, we continue to anticipate deal payments related to prior business transactions to be in line with last year, around $2 billion, excluding Acerta. We have paid just under $1 billion in the first half. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio continues to decrease and is now at 1.9 times or 1.7 times, if excluding the non-cash adjustment for the Alexion inventory fair value uplift, which will soon disappear as we have now minimal inventory remaining from the time of the acquisition.

Today, we are reiterating our 2023 total revenue and core EPS guidance. Total revenues are expected to increase by low to mid-single-digit percentage. Excluding COVID-19 total revenue are expected to increase by low double-digit percentage. Growth in the second half will be hampered by patented expiries, including SynCor in the U.S. and Nexium in Japan, where we saw first generics end of last year. We now anticipate revenue in China to increase by a low to mid-single-digit percentage. And as I mentioned earlier, we now anticipate total operating expenses on the our end of the range, with phasing of SG&A costs towards the second half of the year, similar to prior years. In addition, given that we anticipate starting several new Phase 3 trials in the second half of the year, R&D and associated clinical and new product costs will be higher in the second half.

Based on June average FX rates, we now anticipate a low single-digit adverse FX impact on total revenue and a low to mid-single-digit adverse impact on core EPS. Please advance to the next slide. Continuing with the artificial intelligence team, today, I want to highlight global operations and how we are leveraging AI to accelerate drug development manufacturing processes and drive supply chain efficiencies. To share three specific examples here. First, in drug development, with our in-house AI-enabled tool, loop manager, we have reduced in route synthesis lead times from 9 to 12 months to five to six months, and we're striving to further reduce lead times to less than three months. Additionally, with this tool, we have been able to reduce the number of experimental trials cutting lead times and driving efficiencies in case while also providing sustainability benefits through fewer synthetic steps.

Next, with AI-powered visualization of data, our operators are able to improve process performance for synthetic and biologic medicine by identifying critical variables that will affect yields and make real-time optimization adjustments. In the future, advanced continuous process verification will drive further robustness and yield increases. Third example, we've implemented AI-enabled enhancements across our supply chain. For example, Sweden is one of our largest global sites, manufacturing over 12 billion tablets and capsules every year. Here, we use AI-powered digital twins that can leverage multiple data sources simultaneously, such as production orders, dispensing stations and cleaning status to optimize production schedules. This technology has already delivered a 90% improvement in scheduling time, meaning we can now develop a dispensing plan in only four to five [ph] minutes worth used to take eight hours.

Our ambition is to leverage many of these tools and roll them throughout our manufacturing and supply network. This is, of course, a journey, but the work is already underway to use technology to drive efficiencies. While our operations team continues to deliver on seamless supply and new product launch delivery. With that, please advance to the next slide, and I will hand over to Dave to walk through our oncology business performance.

David Fredrickson: Thank you, Aradhana. Next slide, please. We're pleased to report our oncology medicines delivered total revenues in the first half of $8.8 billion, an increase of 22% versus the prior year. We delivered double-digit product sales growth across all regions. Turning to individual medicine performance in the second quarter, Tagrisso Global revenues grew 10%, reflecting strong underlying demand for Dora and Flora across all regions. As expected, effective this June, we realized a mandatory price reduction in Japan. And in China, second quarter revenues reflect the first full quarter of -- renewal pricing following reenlistment this March. Following the ASCO plenary presentation of Adora overall survival data last month, we expect expanded use of Tagrisso in the adjuvant setting as well as potential for new reimbursements in certain geographies.

Lastly, as we consider the future impact from IRA, our current interpretation of CMS final guidance supports the potential exclusion for Tagrisso under orphan drug protections. Lynparza remains the leading PARP inhibitor globally and delivered -- sales growth of 9%. In the US, we saw sequential demand decline across the PARP inhibitor class following competitor label restrictions in second-line ovarian cancer. We continue to work on opportunities for US demand expansion in ovarian and HR-positive breast cancer, but still expect this to be more challenging. Outside of the US, we saw double-digit product sales growth across the EU, established rest of world, and emerging markets. In Q2, Imfinzi total revenues, inclusive of Imjudo, surpassed $1 billion in a quarter for the first time, up 58% and largely driven by new launches of TOPAZ, HIMALAYA, and POSEIDON.

I'll touch on specific Imfinzi growth drivers a bit later, but needless to say, we're excited by what the team has accomplished within a competitive I-O class. Calquence total revenues increased 34% year-on-year, supported by ex-US demand growth, particularly in Europe. And in the US, Calquence continues to maintain leadership in frontline CLL with the majority of new patient starts in this setting. However, we continue to see some new patient share loss in the relapsed/refractory segment. In HER2 total revenues of $322 million in the second quarter increased 176% year-on-year. In the US in HER2 new patient share in the HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer setting remains at a -- and in the hormone receptor positive HER2 low post chemo-metastatic breast cancer share has now grown to above 50%.

Importantly, we're seeing strong continued demand across the globe, particularly in European markets. Following the exciting approval for DESTINY-Breast03 in China last quarter, we received approval for HER2 in HER2 low metastatic breast cancer. Also during the period, we received approval for PROPEL in the US and anticipate a potential regulatory milestone to be paid in the second half of the year. And finally, we were granted priority review in the US for Capitala 291. Next slide, please. We've seen remarkable Imfinzi and Imjudo growth, driven by the recent launches of TOPAZ, HIMALAYA, and POSEIDON. We're excited about the current trajectory of these launches and the broader potential of Imfinzi as supported by the suite of ongoing life cycle management programs.

First, HIMALAYA and unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma has established a clear foothold for Imfinzi in GI cancers. Last month at ESMO World GI, we presented unprecedented four-year overall survival data, the longest follow-up to-date in unresectable HCC. This sustained benefit, coupled with strong safety will continue to support rapid adoption and the establishment of a new standard-of-care. The launch of TOPAZ represents a step change innovation in biliary tract cancer and the strength of this data demonstrates the transformative benefit of IO in this setting. In the US, TOPAZ has become the undisputed standard-of-care within months. and the EU and Japan much are already outpacing the US trajectory. We're making progress with POSEIDON in the US and in Europe with a crowded and competitive setting.

This launch together with our efforts with Pacific and Caspian continue to solidify a strong leadership position within lung cancer. In the first half of this year, we delivered four positive Phase III trials of novel Imfinzi combinations across lung, GI and GYN settings. MATTERHORN and gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer was the first global Phase III and trial of IO plus flat that demonstrates statistically significant pathologic complete response. In endometrial cancer, we are excited to report that DOE showed Imfinzi + Lynparza and Imfinzi alone significantly improved progression-free survival, and Susan will cover these trials in more detail shortly. Over the balance of the year, we look forward to additional Phase III readouts with PACIFIC-2 in lung cancer and EMERALD-1 in GI.

Building on HIMALAYA, EMERALD-1 and EMERALD-2 will enable our leadership in HCC. Finally, we'll continue to advance our next wave of IO with our novel bispecifics, volrustomig and rivagustimig and sabestomig. With that, please advance to the next slide, and I'll hand over to Susan to cover key R&D highlights in the quarter.

The industry is replete with businesses boasting robust pipelines, each vying for a breakthrough that could potentially revolutionize healthcare.

Today’s article sheds light on three high-potential pharma stocks that hold strong promise for the future. These companies are among the cream of the crop regarding R&D pipeline size as of 2023, demonstrating a powerful blend of innovation and growth potential.

The journey towards significant medical advancements is akin to a marathon, where incremental progress can eventually lead to transformative therapies. This landscape offers compelling opportunities for investors willing to delve deeper. So, let’s explore these pharma stocks to watch, each armed with a powerful pipeline poised to shape the future of healthcare.

Promising Pharma Stocks: Pfizer (PFE)  Here's How Pfizer Stock (and Pharma) Stand to Benefit From Mylan Deal

Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com

Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is a renowned pharmaceutical business, viewed as an undervalued blue-chip stock with massive long-term growth potential. Further enhancing its appeal as an income stock is its attractive dividend yield of more than 4.5%, which could offer investors steady income in the coming years.

Certainly, Pfizer is grappling with a myriad of uncertainties, including concerns over its growth prospects post-pandemic. Naturally, it was one of the biggest pharma players during the pandemic, and the steep comps significantly impacted its financials. However, the company is confronting these challenges head-on by investing aggressively in research and development.

These R&D efforts are projected to produce a robust pipeline, potentially generating more than $20 billion in incremental sales from new molecular entities by the conclusion of the current decade. Furthermore, new business developments are expected to contribute another $25 billion in revenue by the same timeline.

Merck (NYSE:MRK) the powerhouse behind treatments such as Keytruda and Gardasil, poses a fruitful opportunity for discerning investors. It’s a stalwart that’s not just recognized for its healthcare solutions but an attractive quarterly dividend yield of more than 2.58%.

Despite the slower sales of Lagevrio, Merck’s coronavirus antiviral pill tugged revenues down 9% to $14.5 billion in the first quarter this year. A look into its R&D pipeline reveals a focus on a broad spectrum of diseases, spotlighting oncology, infectious diseases, cardio-metabolic disorders, and neuroscience. Some noteworthy candidates, such as gefapixant for overactive bladder, filodesin for type 2 diabetes, and others, point to its massive long-term potential.

Merck’s market position remains sturdy, with nearly half its robust pipeline close to regulatory approval. Apart from that, its existing product offerings are generating sales of more than $40 billion, making it a name to watch in the pharma sphere.

AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) is anticipated to make a promising rebound despite the recent sluggishness attributed to decreased demand for its Covid products. The UK-based pharmaceutical giant stands out among the best dividend-paying growth stocks, prepped to entice investors with predicted high single-digit to low double-digit earnings growth this year. The projected growth is linked to flourishing drugs such as its cancer treatment Calquence and the diabetes therapy Farxiga, set to balance dwindling sales of its Covid-related offerings effectively.

The company’s future looks even more radiant when peering further down the timeline. With a low double-digit CAGR projected through 2025, AstraZeneca plans to blow past industry averages and maintain its reputation for robust growth.

An impressive phase three pipeline of 30 drugs slated for 2023 lends credibility to these projections and 10 potential blockbusters in the mix. The company’s hefty pipeline of 178 projects and robust global presence casts a ray of optimism on AstraZeneca’s prospects.

This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.4% gain on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.52%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 10.86%.

Heading into today, shares of the company had gained 7.39% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 2.6% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.98% in that time.

Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Atlassian as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be August 3, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Atlassian to post earnings of $0.43 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 59.26%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $911.23 million, up 19.92% from the prior-year quarter.

Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Atlassian. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.

Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.

The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell).

46,2023-07-26T11:00:15+00:00,Is Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM) Expensive For A Reason? A Look At Its Intrinsic Value,"Key Insights

The projected fair value for Atlassian is US$132 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Atlassian is estimated to be 35% overvalued based on current share price of US$178 The US$187 analyst price target for TEAM is 42% more than our estimate of fair value

Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.

Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.

View our latest analysis for Atlassian

Step By Step Through The Calculation

We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.

Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:

10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast

2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$989.9m US$1.29b US$2.00b US$2.14b US$2.24b US$2.33b US$2.40b US$2.47b US$2.54b US$2.60b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x17 Analyst x11 Analyst x2 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 3.71% Est @ 3.23% Est @ 2.89% Est @ 2.66% Est @ 2.49% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1%  US$916 US$1.1k US$1.6k US$1.6k US$1.5k US$1.5k US$1.4k US$1.3k US$1.3k US$1.2k

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$13b

The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.1%.

Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.6b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.1%) = US$45b

Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$45b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$21b

The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$34b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$178, the company appears potentially overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf

The Assumptions

Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Atlassian as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.002. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

Looking Ahead:

Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Autodesk's (NASDAQ:ADSK) look very promising so lets take a look.

What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?

If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Autodesk:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.20 = US$1.0b ÷ (US$9.1b - US$3.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).

Therefore, Autodesk has an ROCE of 20%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Software industry average of 9.4%.

Check out our latest analysis for Autodesk  roce

In the above chart we have measured Autodesk's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our freereport for Autodesk.

How Are Returns Trending?

The fact that Autodesk is now generating some pre-tax profits from its prior investments is very encouraging. Shareholders would no doubt be pleased with this because the business was loss-making five years ago but is is now generating 20% on its capital. In addition to that, Autodesk is employing 150% more capital than previously which is expected of a company that's trying to break into profitability. We like this trend, because it tells us the company has profitable reinvestment opportunities available to it, and if it continues going forward that can lead to a multi-bagger performance.

On a side note, Autodesk's current liabilities are still rather high at 43% of total assets. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks.

Our Take On Autodesk's ROCE

To the delight of most shareholders, Autodesk has now broken into profitability. And investors seem to expect more of this going forward, since the stock has rewarded shareholders with a 60% return over the last five years. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.
