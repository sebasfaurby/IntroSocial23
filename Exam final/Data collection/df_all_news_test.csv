2023-06-01T22:45:24+00:00,Apple denies hacking thousands of iPhones in Russian spy plot,"Apple

Apple has denied allegations that it helped US authorities spy on Russian iPhone users.

Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) on Thursday claimed it uncovered a US National Security Agency (NSA) operation which hacked several thousand iPhones using sophisticated surveillance software.

The US intelligence agency was allegedly able to use specifically-designed “software vulnerabilities” to infect Apple’s phones with previously unknown malware, according to Russia’s foreign ministry.

The FSB claimed the espionage operation targeted devices belonging to former Soviet Union members and Russian-based foreign diplomats, including those from Israel, China and NATO.

The successor to Russia’s Soviet-era KGB said that the plot showed “close cooperation” between Apple and the NSA, the US national security agency tasked with collecting and monitoring data.

The FSB said: “The company provides American intelligence agencies with a wide range of opportunities to monitor any persons of interest to the White House and their partners in anti-Russian activities, and their own citizens.”

Apple has denied these claims. The California-based tech giant said: “We have never worked with any government to insert a backdoor into any Apple product and never will.”

According to the FSB, it discovered the covert campaign in collaboration with Russia’s Federal Guards Service, which provides security to the Kremlin.

“The US intelligence services have been using IT corporations for decades in order to collect large-scale data of Internet users without their knowledge,” said Russia’s foreign ministry.

However, the FSB has provided no evidence that Apple cooperated with the NSA or had any awareness of its alleged spying plot.

Kaspersky Lab, a Moscow-based antivirus company, has since reported that an undisclosed number of workers’ iPhones were targeted in “an extremely complex, professionally targeted cyberattack”.

The cybersecurity firm claimed that spyware was installed through vulnerabilities in Apple’s iOS operating system, which then transmitted information from phones to remote servers.

The attack is said to have targeted devices belonging to Kaspersky Lab’s “top and middle-management”.

The incident is likely to increase tensions between Apple and Russia officials, which have long questioned the security of US technology.

It comes after the Kremlin ordered officials involved with Russia’s upcoming 2024 presidential election to stop using iPhones amid security concerns, the Kommersant newspaper reported.",https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-denies-hacking-thousands-iphones-224524561.html,"['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA']",[],"{'polarity': 0.94, 'neg': 0.055, 'neu': 0.848, 'pos': 0.097}"
2023-06-01T22:02:25+00:00,Russia Accuses US Intelligence of Hacking Thousands of iPhones,"(Bloomberg) -- Russia’s main security service accused a US intelligence agency of hacking several thousand iPhones, including devices belonging to Russian nationals and others linked to diplomatic missions and embassies in the country.

The statement from Russia’s Federal Security Service, known as the FSB, was scant on details and didn’t identify which US intelligence agency was behind the alleged attacks. The Russian security agency claimed that Apple Inc., the maker of iPhone, works closely with US intelligence, particularly the National Security Agency. The attacks were linked to SIM cards registered with Russia-based diplomats for NATO countries, Israel and China, according to the statement.

A spokesperson for Apple didn’t comment on whether any Russian iPhones were breached. But the spokesperson said the company hadn’t helped any government breach iPhones, as the FSB suggested, and “never will.” Apple halted product sales in Russia following that country’s invasion of Ukraine, but iPhones are still widely available via parallel import schemes.

A representative for the NSA declined to comment. Spokespeople for the Chinese and Israeli embassies in Washington didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Separately, the Moscow-based cybersecurity company Kaspersky published a blog post saying iPhones belonging to several dozen of its employees had been hacked, and it included technical details of how the operation allegedly worked. The hack went undetected for years, according to the timeline on the blog post. Kaspersky didn’t identify who it believed was behind the attack, which it described as a “extremely complex, professional targeted cyberattack.”

In an email, a Kaspersky spokesman said the hacking campaign was discovered at the beginning of the year. Russian authorities have indicated the attacks are linked, he said, and a Kaspersky employee tweeted that the FSB’s and Kaspersky’s statements were related. Kaspersky said the spyware worked on an older version of Apple’s operating system.

It wasn’t possible to confirm the allegations, which were made at a time of exceptionally fraught relations between the US and Russia over the ongoing war in Ukraine. The US is providing Ukraine with intelligence support and military hardware but is at pains to avoid a direct confrontation with Russia. In addition, just last month, the US Department of Justice announced that it had disrupted a years-long hacking campaign carried out by an infamous FSB unit called “Turla.” The malware, called “Snake,” allegedly impacted over 50 countries and was used by Russian hackers for more than 20 years, according to the US authorities.

The US government banned the use of Kaspersky software from federal systems in 2017, citing espionage fears, and last year, the US Federal Communications Commission placed the Russian firm on a list of companies whose equipment and services have been deemed a national security threat. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, Rob Joyce, the NSA’s director of cybersecurity, told Bloomberg News he was “very worried” about US companies using Kaspersky antivirus products, saying it was “ill-advised with this global situation.”

Cybersecurity experts who reviewed the Kaspersky blog said the hackers appeared to use advanced techniques to breach iPhones, but they added that more information was needed to know definitively.

“The sophistication of these attacks narrows it down to just a handful of the world’s most powerful players in the offensive space, and I have a feeling that we will know more about the origin as soon as Apple starts to notify the victims,” said Zack Ganot, chief executive officer of Israel-based Sunday Security, who reviewed Kasperky’s findings.

The hackers infiltrated the devices by sending a malicious attachment via iMessage, according to Kaspersky. A user isn’t required to click on anything in order for the hack to work, known as a “zero-click” attack. The method is considered the gold standard for hackers breaking into computers or mobile devices and is sold by commercial surveillance companies, including Israel’s NSO Group.

“Kaspersky, arguably one of the best exploit detection companies in the world, was potentially hacked via an iOS zero-day for five years and only now discovered it,” said Patrick Wardle, the founder of the Objective-See Foundation, a nonprofit specializing in Apple security tools and a former NSA employee.

“It would be super risky to go after Kaspersky, basically you’d have to assume eventually you’d get caught,” he said.

The US government and US-based cybersecurity companies often detail the inner workings of alleged hacking operations by foreign actors, particularly those based in Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. But it is unusual for those countries to provide technical details of alleged US hacking campaigns.

In the blog post, CEO Eugene Kaspersky said the spyware, dubbed “triangulation,” “transmits private information to remote servers: microphone recordings, photos from instant messengers, geolocation and data about a number of other activities.” The threat from the attack at the company had been “neutralized,” he said.

Even if you look at some of the most stable investments like savings accounts or CDs, there is no proof that the rate of interest will not change. Inflation has led to a lot of uncertainty when it comes to choosing investment options, but some stocks look safe and stable even in an uncertain environment. Thus, now is as good a time as any to being considering such long-term holdings in your portfolio.

If you are looking for secure retirement stocks to buy, you need to invest in stable and well-established companies that carry low risk and have high-growth potential. Such stocks are reliably profitable and bring a bit of certainty to the portfolio. Smart investors believe in long-term investing to grow their wealth. Instead of timing the market, it is ideal to look for a few long-term stocks for mature investors.

If you are over 30 and are looking for best stocks for long-term investment, here are a few to watch out for.

Visa (V) several Visa branded credit cards

One of the top stocks for investors over 30 is Visa (NYSE:V). The largest payment processor in the world, the company is a market leader today with an excellent business model. Consumers are shifting to electronic payments, and with the instability associated with banks, consumers have accelerated their shift toward plastic.

The company reported solid quarterly results and is enjoying the recovery in travel spending. There are concerns about the economy slowing down, which could have an impact on consumer spending, but Visa doesn’t operate in just one country. It has a global presence, which means the company will continue to generate revenue, no matter the economic situation. This is what makes it one of the safe retirement stocks to buy today.

In the recent quarter, Visa reported a revenue of $7.98 billion, an increase of 11%, earning $2.09 per share. The company saw a 10% rise in payment volume year-over-year, with 7% growth in services revenue. Visa has a dividend yield of 0.8% and recently announced a dividend of $0.40. The company holds massive market share and its business model is working for shareholders.

With our society increasingly going cashless, the rise in credit card sales appears to have no end. Thus, with Visa taking a percentage of every transaction, rising transactions will lead to consistently rising revenue over time. Currently, V stock is trading around $226, up roughly 7% year-to-date. While the stock is moving closer to its 52-week high of $235, all-time highs are also a possibility this year. Visa looks undervalued to me, and is one of the best long-term investment stocks for mature investors.

Alphabet (GOOG) GOOG stock: letters spelling out google

Source: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.com

One of the best stocks to buy for stability is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG). Alphabet is dominating the online advertising space, having become an integral part of our lives. It has changed the way we find and research information, it has also brought video and ads into our lives. One might argue that Google has been facing headwinds, recently posting single-digit revenue growth. However, I believe this blip to be temporary. The company has a solid business model, and is continuing to innovate over time. Additionally, key cost-cutting efforts have helped and it reduced losses in the first quarter.

Alphabet has increased its pace of development in order to counteract the momentum of OpenAI. Alphabet is not limited to Bard when it comes to AI. In many ways, the company already has an edge over competitors in the AI race, in its massive cash and talent hoard.

I’m focused on how Alphabet continues to grow its cloud business. The numbers are proof that it can offset the slowdowns from the other business segments.

Currently, GOOG stock is trading just shy of $125, and is also very close to its 52-week high of $126. The stock is up 38% year to date and 15% in May alone. It was trading at $89 in January, marking one of its best near-term rallies in some time, thanks in part to the AI boom. I think this company is so much more than a play on AI, and for those reasons, it’s among my top stocks to buy right now.

One hot tech stock that is making news lately is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). It is also personally my favorite stock, and one I’ve argued could be a trillion-dollar stock for some time.

Now it is.

There are many reasons for this. The company’s first quarter earnings were a game changer for the tech giant. It crushed earnings, and is seeing massive demand for its chips from AI companies. NVDA is the stock of the moment right now. This hot stock was trading at $182 in Jan 2023 and is up to roughly $400 today. That’s growth of more than 110% in just five months. If you’d bought the stock at my recommendation of $228, you would be sitting on gains of 76%. However, if you missed that opportunity, now is still the time to own NVDA stock and hold it for a decade. It is one of the best stocks to buy and hold for investors over 30.

The potential of AI is massive, and Nvidia is only getting started. The company recently revealed a supercomputer and AI platform, which led to the stock soaring. The company’s management team believes that these tools are important for many of its clients. I expect the company’s recent solid results to continue, and believe this is one of the best long-term stocks to buy, even though it’s already seen so much appreciation of late.

Morgan Stanley on Thursday lowered profit expectations for FedEx for the fiscal year fourth quarter that just ended, partially because of a double-digit decline in domestic flight activity, an indicator that the company moved significantly fewer parcels than previously assumed.

The global financial services company also warned FedEx (NYSE: FDX) revenues could be more important to financial performance than management’s recent focus on cost savings, contrary to consensus thinking on Wall Street.

Domestic aircraft utilization at FedEx Express fell 10% sequentially in April, following a March rebound, and is down 17% year over year, according to new Morgan Stanley research.

There is a strong correlation between cargo flight hours and freight demand. Morgan Stanley equity analyst Ravi Shanker said flight activity is a better predictor of earnings results than relying solely on macroeconomic data points, such as airfreight rates and demand, industrial production, and business surveys.

Morgan Stanley said its model shows FedEx will have adjusted earnings per share of $4.63, 5% below the consensus of $4.87.

“The biggest red flag” was that domestic flight frequency in April “materially underperformed seasonality” as demand for parcel shipping continues to deteriorate, the report said. Morgan Stanley forecast FedEx parcel volumes for the fourth quarter will come in 9% lower than last year, in line with the company’s guidance and better than the 10.5% decline in the third quarter. The revenue environment is also negatively impacted by lower Express yields, especially out of Asia as shippers trade down to deferred service.

Domestic Express shipping accounts for 25% of parcel revenue at FedEx.

The investment bank’s newly launched Parcel Flight Tracker relies on publicly available data and proprietary analytical tools.

The firm’s data aligns with FedEx’s stated intent to reduce flight hours 10% by midsummer following an 8% decrease in the fiscal quarter that ended Feb. 28. Reducing aircraft utilization is part of an effort to align assets with lower demand and coincides with a broader streamlining strategy aimed at eliminating $700 million in annual costs from the air network.

FedEx’s third-quarter revenue fell $1.4 billion to $22.2 billion, with adjusted operating income of $1.17 billion compared to $1.33 billion in the 2022 period.

A decline in flight activity isn’t unique to FedEx. The domestic flight count at UPS (NYSE: UPS) dropped 12% from March to April and is down 9% year over year. UPS is also downsizing flight activity and said it intends to scale back operations by 14% in the Asia-Pacific region this quarter from the prior year.

Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) in-house airline flew 3% less month over month but increased its flight count by 11% from the same period last year, according to Morgan Stanley. The firm noted that the correlation between Amazon’s flight activity and retail sales was not as strong as the comparisons for FedEx and UPS.

Meanwhile, dedicated freighter activity across the airline sector fell 5.2% in April from last year, primarily due to pullbacks in North America and Asia, according to analysis by BMO Capital Markets. April represented the steepest decline in flight hours over the past two years, on a seasonally adjusted basis, it said in a recent research note.

A wild card that could influence FedEx’s earnings is how much ground parcel business switched over from UPS because of potential fears that Teamsters drivers and dockworkers could go on strike when the current five-year contract expires July 31.

Shanker was less optimistic about FedEx’s 2024 fiscal year as short-term cost actions reach their limit, inflation acts as a $5.5 billion headwind and consumer demand normalizes to pre-pandemic growth rates, which suggests the market is still searching for the bottom.

Those factors could offset the $1.5 billion to $2 billion in savings FedEx projects from its DRIVE program, which targets $4 billion in structural costs by fiscal year 2025.

“We believe the real risk to numbers going forward comes from the revenue line,” Shanker wrote. “FDX needs to deliver $4+ billion of revenue growth to merely grow earnings before interest and taxes from here. The street on the other hand is looking for 20%+ EPS growth next year, which we think could be a tough ask.”

He projected full-year EPS will end up slightly above current levels, at about $15.

FedEx is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings on June 20.

2023-06-01T19:43:27+00:00,News From The Pickup Land,"2023 has already been named as the year of the pickup. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) is finally entering this market with its eagerly awaited Cybertruck that is finally entering protection and going on sale later this year. With reportedly 1.6 million orders, all that Tesla has to do is ensure the manufacturing capacity to meet the demand as analyst predict the electric pickup will become mainstream like as the company’s Model Y.

Worksport Launches New Soft Folding Tonneau Cover SC4 Pro

Worksport Ltd (NASDAQ: WKSP) has just revealed an upgrade to its current SC4 tonneau cover that comes with enhanced functionality, durability, and security, allowing pickup owners to more easily open and close the cover. A perhaps even more important strategic move is that Worksport has given its customers high-end features at an affordable price point.

Besides the company’s e-commerce platform, Worksport products are available for sale through multiple distribution channels that include the e-commerce titan Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Walmart Inc (NASDAQ: WKSP). Steven Rossi, CEO of Worksport, stated on the occasion that the latest launch is part of the company’s ongoing commitment to deliver innovative solutions with a superior user experience. Along with this launch, Worksport continues making progress in building its hard-folding tonneau covers at its New York facility. The market continues to eagerly wait for updates regarding the company’s innovative solar-powered tonneau cover SOLIS as well as portable battery system COR. Hyundai is one of the automakers whose Santa Cruz Pickup Truck model will be enhanced by this groundbreaking technology.  Is catching up to Tesla even possible?

The fact alone that Tesla is entering the pickup market is disrupting on its own as this is a company that already redefined electric vehicles with design and specs the automotive industry has never seen before. Then there’s also the promise of the Cybertruck doing something for the pickup market like what Hummer did for SUV drivers in the 2020s, and pickups are, after all, the most lucrative car segment in the U.S. and Tesla is about to enter it. This market has been very straight forward and strict but Tesla already proved it is able to change the rules of the game entirely. However, with other disruptive players in the field like Worksport, this is the first time in EV history that other automakers have a shot at playing against Tesla.
