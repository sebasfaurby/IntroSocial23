2023-07-31T23:54:16+00:00,"Asian stocks push higher on tech strength, China lags","Investing.com -- Most Asian stocks rose on Tuesday, buoyed by strength in technology stocks as markets awaited major U.S. earnings this week, although Chinese markets lagged on more weak economic signals.

Regional markets took positive cues from a strong overnight finish on Wall Street, although focus remained chiefly on upcoming earnings reports from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). But strong results from tech heavyweights Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) last week set a positive tone for the upcoming earnings.

Optimism over improving global economic prospects - amid easing inflation and resilient growth in major economies - also spurred flows into risk-heavy stocks.

Tech-heavy indexes lead gains

South Korea’s KOSPI was the best performer for the day, up over 1% on strength in heavyweight chipmaking stocks. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930) rose 1.2% after U.S. memory chip making peer Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) said that the worst for the industry was over, even as the firm forecast a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss and revenue drop.

Strength in internet giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (HK:9988) (NYSE:BABA), Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), and Baidu Inc (HK:9888) (NASDAQ:BIDU) kept the Hang Seng index in positive territory, even as other sectors on the index logged steep losses. Property developer Country Garden (HK:2007) slid over 5% after it scrapped a $300 million capital raise.

The Taiwan Weighted index logged small gains, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.6% on strong automobile and tech stocks.

Sentiment towards Japanese stocks was also aided by emergency bond buying by the Bank of Japan, which pushed up bets that the bank was in no hurry to tighten policy immediately.

Futures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a flat open, although both indexes were close to hitting record highs on strength in heavyweight tech stocks.

Story continues

Still, gains in most markets were limited as investors remained wary of key U.S. nonfarm payrolls data this week. Mixed economic cues from China also dented sentiment.

Australia’s ASX 200 rose 0.3% ahead of a closely-watched Reserve Bank decision later in the day. Markets are split over whether the bank will hike rates further.

Chinese stocks lag on weak PMIs, stimulus in focus

China’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 index rose just 0.1%, while the Shanghai Composite fell slightly as a private survey showed on Tuesday that the country’s manufacturing sector unexpectedly shrank in July.

The reading follows a dismal official survey for July, and shows that China’s biggest economic engines are seeing little signs of recovery this year.

The reading spurred more expectations of stimulus measures from the country, with officials promising more policies to boost domestic consumption and activity. But they have so far offered no clear specifics on the policies, which has left investors somewhat wary of local stocks.

While the prospect of more Chinese stimulus had spurred strong gains in local stocks over the past week, the momentum now appears to be slowing.

2023-07-31T21:01:39+00:00,The 2023 stock market rally got a lot healthier in June and July,"July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.

But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.

And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.

This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.

Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notable, however, that Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years. S&P 500 Sectors Were All Green from June to July 2023

In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.

The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL) which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector, too.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.

And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)

Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.

In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May. A sign hangs above the entrance of a Kohl's store on March 01, 2023 in Lincolnwood, Illinois. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)

Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.

The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.

Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.

3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).

Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.

Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%. Telecom company Verizon (VZ) and pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) are also toward the bottom.

2023-07-31T19:52:35+00:00,7 Stocks to Buy Before They Surpass 2021 Highs,"The stock market has rebounded in 2023 following a year marked by rate hikes that pulled everything much lower. Leading indexes fell dramatically with the S&P 500 shedding 18.25% of its value. Hikes pounded the tech-heavy Nasdaq which fell by more than 30% during the same period. The emergence of AI, along with slowing rate hikes, has catalyzed a rebound in the markets in 2023. However, major indexes haven’t reached their 2021 highs. With inflation falling and rate hikes nearly over there’s reason to believe that the markets- and stocks could surge past their high marks in 2021. Let’s dive into a few of the top stocks to watch before new peaks.

Stocks to Watch Before New Peaks: AMD (AMD) man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% Upside

Source: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.com

I’ve been saying the same thing about AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) stock for the past few weeks. If you’ve read my articles during that period, this will be a bit repetitive. That said, it remains true and serves as a logical basis for prices to move upward: AMD is not that far behind its main rival, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).

The reason to believe that this is true lies in research recently released by MosaicML, a machine learning firm that was recently acquired by Databricks. MosaicML undertook extensive testing of the second-most powerful chips from AMD and Nvidia in relation to their AI prowess.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The result was particularly inspiring for AMD champions: Its chips are nearly as fast as those from Nvidia. Further, AMD’s relative strengths in software development are particularly relevant to AI. The software has been identified as an area from which rapid AI improvements will emerge. It all points to the idea that AMD could run much higher. AMD hit $154 in 2021 and currently stands at $111.

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock traded roughly $5 higher at its 2021 peak from its current price. You may be tempted to believe that those higher prices are logical given that it was one of the major firms to produce a Covid-19 vaccine. The logic is that revenues spiked on its approval and that Johnson & Johnson lacks a similar catalyst at the moment.

Story continues

While it’s true that there is no similar catalyst for the firm at the moment, there’s a simple reason to believe in JNJ shares. Johnson & Johnson’s revenues reached $94.94 billion in 2021. In 2023, they’re expected to eclipse $100 billion. Is that astronomical growth by any stretch of the imagination? No, not all. However, it does prove that JNJ is bigger than it was even when it had a Covid-19 vaccine. The other vaccine winners, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) will have far smaller revenue bases in 2023 than each did in 2021, respectively.

JNJ is the most stable of the bunch. Its revenues will be greater in 2023 than in 2021. Thus, its price-to-sales ratio is more attractive at the moment. Add in JNJ’s dividend and the choice gets even easier.

Stocks to Watch Before New Peaks: Coca-Cola (KO) Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker cryptos

Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) shares traded for $60 at their peak in 2021. KO stock currently trades for $62.50 so it has actually surpassed its 2021 highs. Nevertheless, it remains worth considering at this point.

The firm released second-quarter earnings on July 26 which were very strong. Those earnings showed that sales remain very strong, growing at 6% with organic revenue growing at 11%.

That allowed management to raise its full-year forecast for organic revenue growth to between 8-9% from a previous 7-8% in 2023. The results come as Coca-Cola has raised prices even as consumers are already dealing with inflation that erodes their purchasing power. It indicates that demand remains very strong overall.

It’s difficult to find much fault in Coca-Cola’s execution and results even if you feel they could have given consumers a break in pricing. Shareholders are certainly happy. EPS increased by 34%, reaching $0.59. KO stock’s dividend is a bonus and yields nearly 3% currently.

Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) currently makes a lot of sense as a stock investment. The search giant just released second-quarter earnings that were much better than expected and should galvanize a period in which share prices rise.

Revenues for the quarter reached $74.6 billion, ahead of the $72.9 billion Wall Street had been expecting. That earnings beat will be consequential for investors over the coming weeks and months. The beat led to strong income growth of 14.79%(1) which was another bright spot for the firm.

Revenue growth reached 7% on a year-over-year basis down from 13% a year earlier. Slowing growth rates should matter but I’d argue they’re less of a concern due to the overall trajectory. Alphabet is expecting more than $300 billion in sales this year which is a turnaround from the $283 billion in 2022. Search, advertising, Cloud, and other bets are all growing and as rate hikes stop GOOG stock is in a strong position overall relative to its 2021 peak prices.

Meta Platforms (META)  hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks

Investors should consider riding the upward momentum in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock. The fundamental case underpinning that idea is very solid. That’s where we’ll start.

Here’s what I particularly like about META shares currently: Even though the firm’s revenues grew in both the last 3 months and the last 6 months, net income did not. It decreased on a year-over-year basis during the most recent 6 months. However, it increased on a year-over-year basis during the latest 3-month period on a year-over-year basis. That suggests that Meta Platforms is doing much better now and that a real turnaround is in effect.

That’s true despite the fact that Reality Labs’ losses are getting bigger. Ad revenues and its Facebook and Instagram apps have rebounded. That’s very important to the overall narrative for Meta. The economy looks to have dodged the worst outcomes of rate hikes at this point. That should inspire businesses to spend more on ad revenue and continue to bolster META shares in the process.

Albemarle (ALB)  tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocks

Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) has emerged as one of the more important EV stocks over the past few years. Its position is secured in the sector. Lithium demand is expected to grow. Those factors are powerful and have led Albemarle to make bold projections that should have investor interest piqued.

Before I get into that, let me quickly note how rapidly Albemarle is growing. In Q1, revenues grew by 129% reaching $2.6 billion while net income rose by 389%. Even though prices were not stable those results proved that lithium demand is massive on EV sales that aren’t weakening.

Let’s get back to those projections. Albemarle increased its 2030 lithium demand forecast by 15% over its previous expectations early this year. The company anticipates increasing demand through 2030 paired with a supply shortfall. The economic takeaway is clear: Prices are going to rise over the long term. Current prices make for a good entry point.

Microsoft (MSFT)  Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares recently tested new all-time highs of $350 before quickly falling to $330. I think the market has got it wrong: MSFT stock is worth $350 per share. The decline is an opportunity.

The reason to believe so is simple: Microsoft traded at $330 in 2021, a year in which the company reported $168 in sales. It could eclipse $240 billion in sales this year. Thus, its price-to-sales ratio clearly favors the notion that share prices could burst above $350 moving forward.

Why shouldn’t investors believe that idea? After all, Microsoft has made massive strides in AI. It is finding new revenue streams therein. Office 365 AI integrations are the latest news on that front. Time will tell how that goes. In any case, Microsoft is now a better firm than it was back in 2021 when it traded at a similar price. It’s a very simple, logical argument, and simple, logical arguments are often very powerful.

2023-07-31T19:44:19+00:00,11 Most Advanced AI Companies,"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 11 most advanced AI companies. To skip our detailed analysis of current trends in the artificial intelligence sector, you can take a look at the 5 Most Advanced AI Companies.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is all the markets can talk about these days and for good reason. This form of technology has managed to revolutionize the tech industry in a shockingly short period of time, making every major tech company out there think that the AI space is where they have to be in 2023. Companies across a whole range of fields are quickly making AI investments their top priority, as several surveys conducted this year have shown.

AI Investments On The Rise

One such survey is the CNBC Technology Executive Council survey, the results of which were announced on June 23. The survey asked companies about which technologies they expected to allocate the most capital to over the next 12 months. Options in the answer included AI, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Of the companies answering the survey, 47.37% said that AI would be their top choice, while 21.05% and 10.53% voted for cloud computing and IoT, respectively. Based on this survey, it can be said that the AI boom will continue to dominate the tech narrative over the foreseeable future just as much as it has been dominating this year. The survey also revealed that 58% of the voting companies saw AI as a critical tech strategy they will be implementing over the next 12 months. Additionally, 53% of the respondents noted that machine learning (ML) will be their critical tech strategy over the same period. Finally, when it comes to AI spending, 63% of the respondents noted that they are accelerating their investments in this technology, 37% of the respondents noted that they are proceeding with caution when it comes to AI spending, and no respondent said that they are not investing in AI.

These statistics highlight just how widespread and pervasive the current AI buzz really is. This bodes well for companies massively invested in this space, such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA),  Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW). A look at Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) recent disclosure of its AI chatbot Co-Pilot's subscription fees shows just how much these companies are banking on AI today. The subscription fee was announced at $30 per month, and according to CNBC on July 25, the potential market for this product is ""huge."" This is unsurprising considering the fact that ""hundreds of millions"" of Microsoft 365 users are currently making up the potential user base for this new subscription. Additionally, analysts are expected segments like the Azure Cloud business to also help Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) benefit from the AI boom. This segment has seen slowing growth recently, but in light of the company's active involvement in the AI space, analysts now forecast a growth of 25% for Azure Cloud in the latest quarter.

These are just some of the exciting developments brewing in the tech and AI space this year. There's much more to keep an eye on if you are looking to buy into the AI boom in the hopes of benefitting from it in the long run. Considering the vast range of possibilities presented by AI this year, we have compiled a list of some of the most advanced AI companies in the market today. These include the biggest AI companies in the world alongside several emerging AI companies that have been innovating in this space. Most Advanced AI Companies

Our Methodology

Using a consensus-based approach by consulting several sources online, we have selected AI companies that have been making innovative moves in the sector this year. They are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest. We used Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter to rank them.

Most Advanced AI Companies

11. C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24

C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) is an enterprise artificial intelligence software company. It is based in Redwood City, California. The company's platform provides an application development and runtime environment enabling customers to design, develop, and deploy enterprise AI applications. Its new product, C3 Generative AI for Enterprise Search, gives enterprise users access to generative AI tech in data management and more.

Joe Goodwin, an analyst at JMP Securities, maintains an Outperform rating on shares of C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) as of July 24. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $38 to $40.

There were 24 hedge funds long C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $151.9 million.

Here's what Kerrisdale Capital said about C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) in its March 2023 investor letter:

“We are short shares of C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI), a $4 billion market capitalization enterprise software company that has risen from the ashes of its busted IPO based on the misconception that its self-proclaimed “AI leadership” somehow positions it to benefit from Silicon Valley’s current tech theme du jour: generative AI as represented by media obsession ChatGPT. We believe these speculative flames won’t burn bright much longer, as the realities of C3’s poor customer traction, failing sales partnerships, and financial pressures will catalyze what is likely to be a painful reality check.

This isn’t the first time C3 has sought to ride a hot investment theme. The company was originally founded as C3 Energy to develop analytics solutions for public utilities preparing for the emergence of cap-and-trade and smart grids. C3 pivoted in 2016, renaming the company C3 IoT to capitalize on that buzzy opportunity. But management’s master stroke was rebranding operations as C3.ai in 2019 and going public with the “AI” stock ticker, thus securing its place as the default artificial intelligence stock play for the undiscriminating investor despite the bulk of its business coming from relatively dated analytics models built for a very small number of utility, energy, and government customers. C3 is a minor, cash-burning consulting and services business masquerading as a software company, and its true value is a fraction of its current market capitalization…” (Click here to read the full text)

Like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA),  Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) is a highly innovative AI company.

The company’s base business is benefitting from a number of secular tailwinds, the three most prevalent being: 1) data-driven decision making, 2) cloud adoption, and 3) the exponential growth of corporate data. The company’s visionary management team, headed by industry veteran Frank Slootman, plans to capture its fair share of this growth through: 1) executing on its land and expand model, 2) acquiring new customers, 3) growing internationally, and 4) expanding its nascent partner network. The stock’s negative contribution in the quarter was due to the timing of Ithaka’s purchase (mid-February) and its small portfolio weighting (100bps).”

2023-07-31T23:54:16+00:00,"Asian stocks push higher on tech strength, China lags","Investing.com -- Most Asian stocks rose on Tuesday, buoyed by strength in technology stocks as markets awaited major U.S. earnings this week, although Chinese markets lagged on more weak economic signals.

Regional markets took positive cues from a strong overnight finish on Wall Street, although focus remained chiefly on upcoming earnings reports from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). But strong results from tech heavyweights Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) last week set a positive tone for the upcoming earnings.

Optimism over improving global economic prospects - amid easing inflation and resilient growth in major economies - also spurred flows into risk-heavy stocks.

Tech-heavy indexes lead gains

South Korea’s KOSPI was the best performer for the day, up over 1% on strength in heavyweight chipmaking stocks. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930) rose 1.2% after U.S. memory chip making peer Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) said that the worst for the industry was over, even as the firm forecast a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss and revenue drop.

Strength in internet giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (HK:9988) (NYSE:BABA), Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), and Baidu Inc (HK:9888) (NASDAQ:BIDU) kept the Hang Seng index in positive territory, even as other sectors on the index logged steep losses. Property developer Country Garden (HK:2007) slid over 5% after it scrapped a $300 million capital raise.

The Taiwan Weighted index logged small gains, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.6% on strong automobile and tech stocks.

Sentiment towards Japanese stocks was also aided by emergency bond buying by the Bank of Japan, which pushed up bets that the bank was in no hurry to tighten policy immediately.

Futures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a flat open, although both indexes were close to hitting record highs on strength in heavyweight tech stocks.

Story continues

Still, gains in most markets were limited as investors remained wary of key U.S. nonfarm payrolls data this week. Mixed economic cues from China also dented sentiment.

Australia’s ASX 200 rose 0.3% ahead of a closely-watched Reserve Bank decision later in the day. Markets are split over whether the bank will hike rates further.

Chinese stocks lag on weak PMIs, stimulus in focus

China’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 index rose just 0.1%, while the Shanghai Composite fell slightly as a private survey showed on Tuesday that the country’s manufacturing sector unexpectedly shrank in July.

The reading follows a dismal official survey for July, and shows that China’s biggest economic engines are seeing little signs of recovery this year.

The reading spurred more expectations of stimulus measures from the country, with officials promising more policies to boost domestic consumption and activity. But they have so far offered no clear specifics on the policies, which has left investors somewhat wary of local stocks.

While the prospect of more Chinese stimulus had spurred strong gains in local stocks over the past week, the momentum now appears to be slowing.

2023-07-31T19:58:57+00:00,20 Worst Performing Economies in 2023,"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 20 worst performing economies in 2023. To skip our detailed analysis of the global economies, you can go directly to 5 Worst Performing Economies in 2023.

Global Economic Outlook

The global economy is facing a transition from the massive economic downfall during the pandemic and Russia’s war against Ukraine. The global economy was negatively impacted by the supply chain issues following the lockdown during the pandemic. However, supply chain disruptions are shrinking and businesses are improving around the world. At the same time, the monetary policies of central banks should begin to produce the outcomes, with the inflation rate expected to move back toward its target. In 2023, the global economy is expected to slowly get back on track.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its July 2023 World Economic Outlook highlights that global growth will drop to 3% in both 2023 and 2024, falling from an estimated 3.5% in 2022. Global inflation will continue to decrease but at a much slower rate than initially anticipated, from 8.7% in 2022 to 6.8% in 2023. The core inflation is expected to remain moderate, and inflation forecast for 2024 has been revised upward. The main cause behind this was the COVID-19 pandemic and trade tensions after the Russia-Ukraine war. During the press briefing of the July 2023 World Economic Outlook, the following comments were made regarding economic development:

""The global economy continues to gradually recover from the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but it is not yet out of the woods. The COVID-19 health crisis is officially over, supply chain disruptions have returned to pre-pandemic levels, economic activity in the first quarter of the year proved resilient, and labor markets are quite tight in many places. Energy and food prices have come down faster than expected from the war-induced peaks. And financial instability following the March banking turmoil remains contained thanks to forceful actions by the U.S. and Swiss authorities.

Stronger growth and lower inflation than expected are welcome news, suggesting the global economy is headed in the right direction. Yet growth remains low by historical standards, and while some adverse risks have moderated, the balance remains tilted to the downside, and it is too early to celebrate. There are growing signs that global activity is losing momentum. The global tightening of monetary policy has brought interest rates into contractionary territory. This has started to weigh down on activity, slowing the growth of credit to the nonfinancial sector, increasing households' and firms' interest payments, and putting pressure on real estate markets.

Second core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, remains well above central bank targets, and is expected to decline only gradually. In advanced economies, core inflation is expected to remain unchanged at 5.1 percent this year before declining to 3.1 percent in 2024. Clearly, the battle against inflation is not yet won.

Key to inflation's persistence will be labor market developments and wage profit dynamics. Despite tight labor markets, overall wage inflation has increased, but remains behind price inflation in most countries. The reason is simple and has little to do with so called greedflation. Prices adjust upwards faster than wages when nominal demand far exceeds what the economy can produce. As a result, real wages have declined. If labor markets remain strong, we should expect and welcome real wages recovering lost ground. Indeed the gap between nominal wage growth and price inflation has started to close. Because firms' profit margins have grown robustly in the last two years, we remain confident that there is room to accommodate the rebound in real wages without triggering a wage price spiral. With inflation expectations well-anchored in major economies and the economy slowing, market pressures should help contain the passthrough from labor cost to prices.""

In the medium term, overall economic growth is expected to slow down. Especially, developed economies are expected to face a slowdown in their economy, as the growth is expected to fall from 2.7% in 2022 to 1.5% in 2023. In comparison, the growth in developing economies and emerging markets is expected to remain stable at 4% in 2023 and 4.1% in 2024. According to the World Economic Forum’s Chief Economists' Outlook, the global economy seems gloomy. The majority of chief economists project moderate or strong growth in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia. Some of the most important economies in the world from the following regions include Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, India, and Japan.

How are Businesses Recovering?

After a long halt during the pandemic, companies from different sectors are making strong progress. Most importantly, it depends on the sector in which a company is operating. Some sectors have performed exceptionally well while some have been struggling. So far in 2023, the worst performing sectors have been healthcare, energy, and utilities. For instance, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) shares have plunged almost 30% since the start of the year, as of July 31. Whereas, consumer discretionary and technology have outperformed other sectors in the market. As we mentioned earlier, the tech sector is having a great time this year. Most investors are betting on tech stocks regardless of high inflation concerns. One of the main reasons why the tech sector has skyrocketed is the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) hype. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google is making massive progress in AI as the customers are highly interested in its cloud services. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai believes that in the long-term, AI will potentially expand Google's total addressable market and allow them to win new customers. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has some big tech competitors in AI including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

On July 28, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) released its earnings for the second quarter of 2023. The company posted earnings per share of $1.44, beating the expectations of $0.10. The company posted revenue of $74.60 billion and surpassed the consensus by $1.85 billion. Google continues to progress with its cloud business and advance in AI. With so much hope around Google's AI technology and future AI plans, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has soared 10% this week. During the Q2 2023 earnings call, the company made the following comments:

""The momentum across the Company drove our results this quarter. We delivered solid performance in Search and YouTube and ongoing strong growth in Cloud, where we remain focused on long-term value creation. And we continue our important work to operate more efficiently, creating durable savings to fund investments in our biggest priorities.

I’ll talk about this momentum, including our continued leadership in AI and our excitement about the evolution of Search. At I/O, we shared how we are making AI helpful for everyone in four important ways: first, improving knowledge and learning. This is our seventh year as an AI-first company, and we intuitively know how to incorporate AI into our products. Large language models make them even more helpful, models like PaLM 2 and soon Gemini, which we are building to be multimodal. These advances provide an opportunity to reimagine many of our products, including our most important product, Search. We are in a period of incredible innovation for Search, which has continuously evolved over the years. This quarter saw our next major evolution with the launch of the Search Generative Experience, or SGE, which uses the power of generative AI to make search even more natural and intuitive.

User feedback has been very positive so far. It can better answer the queries people come to us with today, while also unlocking entirely new types of questions that Search can answer. For example, we found that generative AI can connect the dots for people as they explore a topic or project, helping them weigh multiple factors and personal preferences before making a purchase or booking a trip. We see this new experience as another jumping off point for exploring the web, enabling users to go deeper to learn about a topic. I’m proud of the engineering excellence underlying our progress. Since the May launch, we’ve boosted serving efficiency, reducing the time it takes to generate AI snapshots by half. We’ll deliver even faster responses over time.

We have made good progress in data center machine efficiency, which will pay dividends as we continue to invest in AI. We continue to slow our expense growth and pace of hiring and ensure our teams are aligned to our highest priorities. This quarter, we reallocated a number of teams, including aligning Waze’s ad sales with our existing business organization. We are combining various engineering efforts across core infrastructure and cloud. Products like Bard and SGE are being built by small fast-moving teams that have been reallocated to these high-priority efforts. Overall, we are actively moving people to higher priority activities within the Company, and we continue to optimize our real estate footprint for current and future needs. Next, Google Cloud.

We see continued growth with Q2 revenue of $8 billion, up 28%, and operating profit of $395 million. Our AI-optimized infrastructure is a leading platform for training and serving generative AI models. More than 70% of gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers, including Cohere, Jasper, Typeface and many more. We provide the widest choice of AI supercomputer options with Google TPUs and advanced NVIDIA GPUs, and recently launched new A3 AI supercomputers powered by NVIDIA’s H100. This enables customers like AppLovin to achieve nearly 2 times better price performance than industry alternatives. Our new generative AI offerings are expanding our total addressable market and winning new customers. We are seeing strong demand for the more than 80 models, including third-party and popular open source in our Vertex, Search and Conversational AI platforms with a number of customers growing more than 15x from April to June.""

20 Worst Performing Economies in 2023

Our Methodology:

To find data for the 20 worst performing economies in 2023, our focus was on the economies with the lowest real GDP growth rate with annual percentage change. The real GDP growth rate reflects the economic growth of an economy expressing its GDP from one period to the next. We ranked the list from the IMF's database which tracks the real GDP growth rate. The economies with the same real GDP growth rate are differentiated based on their GDP at current prices, which was taken from the IMF's database of GDP at current prices. The country with lower GDP at current prices is ranked higher and so on. The list may not include countries such as Western Sahara, Syria, and Lebanon as their data is not available. The lists are then ranked in descending order of the aforementioned metric. Here are the 20 worst performing economies in 2023.

20 Worst Performing Economies in the World

13. Denmark

Real GDP Growth Rate of the Country (2023): 0%

11. Germany

Real GDP Growth Rate of the Country (2023): -0.1%

2023-07-31T19:52:35+00:00,7 Stocks to Buy Before They Surpass 2021 Highs,"The stock market has rebounded in 2023 following a year marked by rate hikes that pulled everything much lower. Leading indexes fell dramatically with the S&P 500 shedding 18.25% of its value. Hikes pounded the tech-heavy Nasdaq which fell by more than 30% during the same period. The emergence of AI, along with slowing rate hikes, has catalyzed a rebound in the markets in 2023. However, major indexes haven’t reached their 2021 highs. With inflation falling and rate hikes nearly over there’s reason to believe that the markets- and stocks could surge past their high marks in 2021. Let’s dive into a few of the top stocks to watch before new peaks.

Stocks to Watch Before New Peaks: AMD (AMD) man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% Upside

Source: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.com

I’ve been saying the same thing about AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) stock for the past few weeks. If you’ve read my articles during that period, this will be a bit repetitive. That said, it remains true and serves as a logical basis for prices to move upward: AMD is not that far behind its main rival, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).

The reason to believe that this is true lies in research recently released by MosaicML, a machine learning firm that was recently acquired by Databricks. MosaicML undertook extensive testing of the second-most powerful chips from AMD and Nvidia in relation to their AI prowess.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The result was particularly inspiring for AMD champions: Its chips are nearly as fast as those from Nvidia. Further, AMD’s relative strengths in software development are particularly relevant to AI. The software has been identified as an area from which rapid AI improvements will emerge. It all points to the idea that AMD could run much higher. AMD hit $154 in 2021 and currently stands at $111.

Stocks to Watch Before New Peaks: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""

Source: PX Media / Shutterstock

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock traded roughly $5 higher at its 2021 peak from its current price. You may be tempted to believe that those higher prices are logical given that it was one of the major firms to produce a Covid-19 vaccine. The logic is that revenues spiked on its approval and that Johnson & Johnson lacks a similar catalyst at the moment.

Story continues

While it’s true that there is no similar catalyst for the firm at the moment, there’s a simple reason to believe in JNJ shares. Johnson & Johnson’s revenues reached $94.94 billion in 2021. In 2023, they’re expected to eclipse $100 billion. Is that astronomical growth by any stretch of the imagination? No, not all. However, it does prove that JNJ is bigger than it was even when it had a Covid-19 vaccine. The other vaccine winners, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) will have far smaller revenue bases in 2023 than each did in 2021, respectively.

JNJ is the most stable of the bunch. Its revenues will be greater in 2023 than in 2021. Thus, its price-to-sales ratio is more attractive at the moment. Add in JNJ’s dividend and the choice gets even easier.

Stocks to Watch Before New Peaks: Coca-Cola (KO) Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker cryptos

Source: Epic Cure / Shutterstock

Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) shares traded for $60 at their peak in 2021. KO stock currently trades for $62.50 so it has actually surpassed its 2021 highs. Nevertheless, it remains worth considering at this point.

The firm released second-quarter earnings on July 26 which were very strong. Those earnings showed that sales remain very strong, growing at 6% with organic revenue growing at 11%.

That allowed management to raise its full-year forecast for organic revenue growth to between 8-9% from a previous 7-8% in 2023. The results come as Coca-Cola has raised prices even as consumers are already dealing with inflation that erodes their purchasing power. It indicates that demand remains very strong overall.

It’s difficult to find much fault in Coca-Cola’s execution and results even if you feel they could have given consumers a break in pricing. Shareholders are certainly happy. EPS increased by 34%, reaching $0.59. KO stock’s dividend is a bonus and yields nearly 3% currently.

Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.

Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.com

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) currently makes a lot of sense as a stock investment. The search giant just released second-quarter earnings that were much better than expected and should galvanize a period in which share prices rise.

Revenues for the quarter reached $74.6 billion, ahead of the $72.9 billion Wall Street had been expecting. That earnings beat will be consequential for investors over the coming weeks and months. The beat led to strong income growth of 14.79%(1) which was another bright spot for the firm.

Revenue growth reached 7% on a year-over-year basis down from 13% a year earlier. Slowing growth rates should matter but I’d argue they’re less of a concern due to the overall trajectory. Alphabet is expecting more than $300 billion in sales this year which is a turnaround from the $283 billion in 2022. Search, advertising, Cloud, and other bets are all growing and as rate hikes stop GOOG stock is in a strong position overall relative to its 2021 peak prices.

Meta Platforms (META)  hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks

Source: shutterstock.com/CC7

Investors should consider riding the upward momentum in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock. The fundamental case underpinning that idea is very solid. That’s where we’ll start.

Here’s what I particularly like about META shares currently: Even though the firm’s revenues grew in both the last 3 months and the last 6 months, net income did not. It decreased on a year-over-year basis during the most recent 6 months. However, it increased on a year-over-year basis during the latest 3-month period on a year-over-year basis. That suggests that Meta Platforms is doing much better now and that a real turnaround is in effect.

That’s true despite the fact that Reality Labs’ losses are getting bigger. Ad revenues and its Facebook and Instagram apps have rebounded. That’s very important to the overall narrative for Meta. The economy looks to have dodged the worst outcomes of rate hikes at this point. That should inspire businesses to spend more on ad revenue and continue to bolster META shares in the process.

Albemarle (ALB)  tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocks

Source: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.com

Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) has emerged as one of the more important EV stocks over the past few years. Its position is secured in the sector. Lithium demand is expected to grow. Those factors are powerful and have led Albemarle to make bold projections that should have investor interest piqued.

Before I get into that, let me quickly note how rapidly Albemarle is growing. In Q1, revenues grew by 129% reaching $2.6 billion while net income rose by 389%. Even though prices were not stable those results proved that lithium demand is massive on EV sales that aren’t weakening.

Let’s get back to those projections. Albemarle increased its 2030 lithium demand forecast by 15% over its previous expectations early this year. The company anticipates increasing demand through 2030 paired with a supply shortfall. The economic takeaway is clear: Prices are going to rise over the long term. Current prices make for a good entry point.

Microsoft (MSFT)  Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares recently tested new all-time highs of $350 before quickly falling to $330. I think the market has got it wrong: MSFT stock is worth $350 per share. The decline is an opportunity.

The reason to believe so is simple: Microsoft traded at $330 in 2021, a year in which the company reported $168 in sales. It could eclipse $240 billion in sales this year. Thus, its price-to-sales ratio clearly favors the notion that share prices could burst above $350 moving forward.

Why shouldn’t investors believe that idea? After all, Microsoft has made massive strides in AI. It is finding new revenue streams therein. Office 365 AI integrations are the latest news on that front. Time will tell how that goes. In any case, Microsoft is now a better firm than it was back in 2021 when it traded at a similar price. It’s a very simple, logical argument, and simple, logical arguments are often very powerful.

2023-07-31T23:54:16+00:00,"Asian stocks push higher on tech strength, China lags","Investing.com -- Most Asian stocks rose on Tuesday, buoyed by strength in technology stocks as markets awaited major U.S. earnings this week, although Chinese markets lagged on more weak economic signals.

Regional markets took positive cues from a strong overnight finish on Wall Street, although focus remained chiefly on upcoming earnings reports from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). But strong results from tech heavyweights Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) last week set a positive tone for the upcoming earnings.

Optimism over improving global economic prospects - amid easing inflation and resilient growth in major economies - also spurred flows into risk-heavy stocks.

Tech-heavy indexes lead gains

South Korea’s KOSPI was the best performer for the day, up over 1% on strength in heavyweight chipmaking stocks. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930) rose 1.2% after U.S. memory chip making peer Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) said that the worst for the industry was over, even as the firm forecast a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss and revenue drop.

Strength in internet giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (HK:9988) (NYSE:BABA), Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), and Baidu Inc (HK:9888) (NASDAQ:BIDU) kept the Hang Seng index in positive territory, even as other sectors on the index logged steep losses. Property developer Country Garden (HK:2007) slid over 5% after it scrapped a $300 million capital raise.

The Taiwan Weighted index logged small gains, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.6% on strong automobile and tech stocks.

Sentiment towards Japanese stocks was also aided by emergency bond buying by the Bank of Japan, which pushed up bets that the bank was in no hurry to tighten policy immediately.

Futures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a flat open, although both indexes were close to hitting record highs on strength in heavyweight tech stocks.

Story continues

Still, gains in most markets were limited as investors remained wary of key U.S. nonfarm payrolls data this week. Mixed economic cues from China also dented sentiment.

Australia’s ASX 200 rose 0.3% ahead of a closely-watched Reserve Bank decision later in the day. Markets are split over whether the bank will hike rates further.

Chinese stocks lag on weak PMIs, stimulus in focus

China’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 index rose just 0.1%, while the Shanghai Composite fell slightly as a private survey showed on Tuesday that the country’s manufacturing sector unexpectedly shrank in July.

The reading follows a dismal official survey for July, and shows that China’s biggest economic engines are seeing little signs of recovery this year.

The reading spurred more expectations of stimulus measures from the country, with officials promising more policies to boost domestic consumption and activity. But they have so far offered no clear specifics on the policies, which has left investors somewhat wary of local stocks.

While the prospect of more Chinese stimulus had spurred strong gains in local stocks over the past week, the momentum now appears to be slowing.

2023-07-31T21:01:39+00:00,The 2023 stock market rally got a lot healthier in June and July,"July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.

But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.

And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.

This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.

Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notable, however, that Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years. S&P 500 Sectors Were All Green from June to July 2023

In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.

The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL) which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector, too.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.

And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)

Story continues

Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.

In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May. A sign hangs above the entrance of a Kohl's store on March 01, 2023 in Lincolnwood, Illinois. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)

Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.

The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.

Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.

3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).

Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.

Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%. Telecom company Verizon (VZ) and pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) are also toward the bottom.

2023-07-31T19:58:57+00:00,20 Worst Performing Economies in 2023,"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 20 worst performing economies in 2023. To skip our detailed analysis of the global economies, you can go directly to 5 Worst Performing Economies in 2023.

Global Economic Outlook

The global economy is facing a transition from the massive economic downfall during the pandemic and Russia’s war against Ukraine. The global economy was negatively impacted by the supply chain issues following the lockdown during the pandemic. However, supply chain disruptions are shrinking and businesses are improving around the world. At the same time, the monetary policies of central banks should begin to produce the outcomes, with the inflation rate expected to move back toward its target. In 2023, the global economy is expected to slowly get back on track.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its July 2023 World Economic Outlook highlights that global growth will drop to 3% in both 2023 and 2024, falling from an estimated 3.5% in 2022. Global inflation will continue to decrease but at a much slower rate than initially anticipated, from 8.7% in 2022 to 6.8% in 2023. The core inflation is expected to remain moderate, and inflation forecast for 2024 has been revised upward. The main cause behind this was the COVID-19 pandemic and trade tensions after the Russia-Ukraine war. During the press briefing of the July 2023 World Economic Outlook, the following comments were made regarding economic development:

""The global economy continues to gradually recover from the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but it is not yet out of the woods. The COVID-19 health crisis is officially over, supply chain disruptions have returned to pre-pandemic levels, economic activity in the first quarter of the year proved resilient, and labor markets are quite tight in many places. Energy and food prices have come down faster than expected from the war-induced peaks. And financial instability following the March banking turmoil remains contained thanks to forceful actions by the U.S. and Swiss authorities.

Stronger growth and lower inflation than expected are welcome news, suggesting the global economy is headed in the right direction. Yet growth remains low by historical standards, and while some adverse risks have moderated, the balance remains tilted to the downside, and it is too early to celebrate. There are growing signs that global activity is losing momentum. The global tightening of monetary policy has brought interest rates into contractionary territory. This has started to weigh down on activity, slowing the growth of credit to the nonfinancial sector, increasing households' and firms' interest payments, and putting pressure on real estate markets.

Second core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, remains well above central bank targets, and is expected to decline only gradually. In advanced economies, core inflation is expected to remain unchanged at 5.1 percent this year before declining to 3.1 percent in 2024. Clearly, the battle against inflation is not yet won.

Key to inflation's persistence will be labor market developments and wage profit dynamics. Despite tight labor markets, overall wage inflation has increased, but remains behind price inflation in most countries. The reason is simple and has little to do with so called greedflation. Prices adjust upwards faster than wages when nominal demand far exceeds what the economy can produce. As a result, real wages have declined. If labor markets remain strong, we should expect and welcome real wages recovering lost ground. Indeed the gap between nominal wage growth and price inflation has started to close. Because firms' profit margins have grown robustly in the last two years, we remain confident that there is room to accommodate the rebound in real wages without triggering a wage price spiral. With inflation expectations well-anchored in major economies and the economy slowing, market pressures should help contain the passthrough from labor cost to prices.""

In the medium term, overall economic growth is expected to slow down. Especially, developed economies are expected to face a slowdown in their economy, as the growth is expected to fall from 2.7% in 2022 to 1.5% in 2023. In comparison, the growth in developing economies and emerging markets is expected to remain stable at 4% in 2023 and 4.1% in 2024. According to the World Economic Forum’s Chief Economists' Outlook, the global economy seems gloomy. The majority of chief economists project moderate or strong growth in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia. Some of the most important economies in the world from the following regions include Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, India, and Japan.

How are Businesses Recovering?

After a long halt during the pandemic, companies from different sectors are making strong progress. Most importantly, it depends on the sector in which a company is operating. Some sectors have performed exceptionally well while some have been struggling. So far in 2023, the worst performing sectors have been healthcare, energy, and utilities. For instance, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) shares have plunged almost 30% since the start of the year, as of July 31. Whereas, consumer discretionary and technology have outperformed other sectors in the market. As we mentioned earlier, the tech sector is having a great time this year. Most investors are betting on tech stocks regardless of high inflation concerns. One of the main reasons why the tech sector has skyrocketed is the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) hype. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google is making massive progress in AI as the customers are highly interested in its cloud services. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai believes that in the long-term, AI will potentially expand Google's total addressable market and allow them to win new customers. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has some big tech competitors in AI including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

On July 28, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) released its earnings for the second quarter of 2023. The company posted earnings per share of $1.44, beating the expectations of $0.10. The company posted revenue of $74.60 billion and surpassed the consensus by $1.85 billion. Google continues to progress with its cloud business and advance in AI. With so much hope around Google's AI technology and future AI plans, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has soared 10% this week. During the Q2 2023 earnings call, the company made the following comments:

""The momentum across the Company drove our results this quarter. We delivered solid performance in Search and YouTube and ongoing strong growth in Cloud, where we remain focused on long-term value creation. And we continue our important work to operate more efficiently, creating durable savings to fund investments in our biggest priorities.

I’ll talk about this momentum, including our continued leadership in AI and our excitement about the evolution of Search. At I/O, we shared how we are making AI helpful for everyone in four important ways: first, improving knowledge and learning. This is our seventh year as an AI-first company, and we intuitively know how to incorporate AI into our products. Large language models make them even more helpful, models like PaLM 2 and soon Gemini, which we are building to be multimodal. These advances provide an opportunity to reimagine many of our products, including our most important product, Search. We are in a period of incredible innovation for Search, which has continuously evolved over the years. This quarter saw our next major evolution with the launch of the Search Generative Experience, or SGE, which uses the power of generative AI to make search even more natural and intuitive.

User feedback has been very positive so far. It can better answer the queries people come to us with today, while also unlocking entirely new types of questions that Search can answer. For example, we found that generative AI can connect the dots for people as they explore a topic or project, helping them weigh multiple factors and personal preferences before making a purchase or booking a trip. We see this new experience as another jumping off point for exploring the web, enabling users to go deeper to learn about a topic. I’m proud of the engineering excellence underlying our progress. Since the May launch, we’ve boosted serving efficiency, reducing the time it takes to generate AI snapshots by half. We’ll deliver even faster responses over time.

We have made good progress in data center machine efficiency, which will pay dividends as we continue to invest in AI. We continue to slow our expense growth and pace of hiring and ensure our teams are aligned to our highest priorities. This quarter, we reallocated a number of teams, including aligning Waze’s ad sales with our existing business organization. We are combining various engineering efforts across core infrastructure and cloud. Products like Bard and SGE are being built by small fast-moving teams that have been reallocated to these high-priority efforts. Overall, we are actively moving people to higher priority activities within the Company, and we continue to optimize our real estate footprint for current and future needs. Next, Google Cloud.

We see continued growth with Q2 revenue of $8 billion, up 28%, and operating profit of $395 million. Our AI-optimized infrastructure is a leading platform for training and serving generative AI models. More than 70% of gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers, including Cohere, Jasper, Typeface and many more. We provide the widest choice of AI supercomputer options with Google TPUs and advanced NVIDIA GPUs, and recently launched new A3 AI supercomputers powered by NVIDIA’s H100. This enables customers like AppLovin to achieve nearly 2 times better price performance than industry alternatives. Our new generative AI offerings are expanding our total addressable market and winning new customers. We are seeing strong demand for the more than 80 models, including third-party and popular open source in our Vertex, Search and Conversational AI platforms with a number of customers growing more than 15x from April to June.""

Some of the best tech stocks to buy according to hedge funds include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).  20 Worst Performing Economies in 2023

20 Worst Performing Economies in 2023

Our Methodology:

To find data for the 20 worst performing economies in 2023, our focus was on the economies with the lowest real GDP growth rate with annual percentage change. The real GDP growth rate reflects the economic growth of an economy expressing its GDP from one period to the next. We ranked the list from the IMF's database which tracks the real GDP growth rate. The economies with the same real GDP growth rate are differentiated based on their GDP at current prices, which was taken from the IMF's database of GDP at current prices. The country with lower GDP at current prices is ranked higher and so on. The list may not include countries such as Western Sahara, Syria, and Lebanon as their data is not available. The lists are then ranked in descending order of the aforementioned metric. Here are the 20 worst performing economies in 2023.

2023-07-31T21:13:11+00:00,Elon Musk Has Been Running On 'Elon Time' Since He Was A Kid — 'I Think I Do Have An Issue With Time' – But It's Not Good For Tesla,"Elon Musk, known for his ambitious timelines, has established a reputation for setting aggressive targets that his companies often fail to meet. As the CEO of Tesla Inc. and SpaceX, Musk has frequently encountered delays in delivering vehicles and launching rockets, with projects falling behind schedule by months or even years.

As a child, he relied on a clever trick devised by his younger brother to ensure he didn’t miss the school bus. Kimbal Musk, a member of Tesla's board, would lie to his older brother by telling him that the bus would arrive a few minutes ahead of schedule. This small manipulation ensured Elon Musk wouldn't be left behind.

Decades later, the business world continues to grapple with the phenomenon known as ""Elon Time."" One shareholder has labeled it as confident pronouncements about delivery timelines, rollouts and milestones that often prove overly optimistic or, at worst, empty spin. Musk acknowledged his issue with time during Tesla's 2018 annual shareholders meeting, immediately after securing his position as chairman.

""I'm a naturally optimistic person. I wouldn't have done cars or rockets if I wasn't. I'm trying to recalibrate as much as possible,"" Musk said.

Most recently, the highly anticipated Cybertruck has faced a delay. Initially slated for production toward the end of 2023, Musk has confirmed that manufacturing will now commence ""sometime this summer."" However, mass production will not begin until the following year, extending the timeline beyond previous expectations.

With manufacturing figures significantly behind schedule and the company grappling with financial challenges, critics warn that ""Elon time"" jeopardizes Tesla's relationship with Wall Street, thereby putting the company's future at risk.

While the term ""Elon time"" evoked laughter during a Q&A session at the meeting, many analysts view the CEO's inclination for making unfulfilled promises as a serious matter. Steve Blank, a retired businessman teaching entrepreneurship at Stanford University, explained the dilemma facing visionary entrepreneurs. Once initial skepticism is overcome and their vision is proven, there is a tendency to believe that every pronouncement they make is infallible.

""It's not that he's been wrong,"" Blank said. ""He's been dead right about building an industry. However, substantial amounts of money have been spent, and now the focus must be on better execution.""

Despite the delays, Musk emphasized that strives to deliver on his promises, albeit not always within the originally projected timeframe.

2023-07-31T21:01:39+00:00,The 2023 stock market rally got a lot healthier in June and July,"July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.

But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.

And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.

This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.

Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notable, however, that Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years. S&P 500 Sectors Were All Green from June to July 2023

In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.

The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL) which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector, too.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.

And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)

Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.

In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May. A sign hangs above the entrance of a Kohl's store on March 01, 2023 in Lincolnwood, Illinois. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)

Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.

The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.

Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.

3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).

Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.

Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%. Telecom company Verizon (VZ) and pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) are also toward the bottom.

2023-07-31T19:58:57+00:00,20 Worst Performing Economies in 2023,"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 20 worst performing economies in 2023. To skip our detailed analysis of the global economies, you can go directly to 5 Worst Performing Economies in 2023.

Global Economic Outlook

The global economy is facing a transition from the massive economic downfall during the pandemic and Russia’s war against Ukraine. The global economy was negatively impacted by the supply chain issues following the lockdown during the pandemic. However, supply chain disruptions are shrinking and businesses are improving around the world. At the same time, the monetary policies of central banks should begin to produce the outcomes, with the inflation rate expected to move back toward its target. In 2023, the global economy is expected to slowly get back on track.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its July 2023 World Economic Outlook highlights that global growth will drop to 3% in both 2023 and 2024, falling from an estimated 3.5% in 2022. Global inflation will continue to decrease but at a much slower rate than initially anticipated, from 8.7% in 2022 to 6.8% in 2023. The core inflation is expected to remain moderate, and inflation forecast for 2024 has been revised upward. The main cause behind this was the COVID-19 pandemic and trade tensions after the Russia-Ukraine war. During the press briefing of the July 2023 World Economic Outlook, the following comments were made regarding economic development:

""The global economy continues to gradually recover from the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but it is not yet out of the woods. The COVID-19 health crisis is officially over, supply chain disruptions have returned to pre-pandemic levels, economic activity in the first quarter of the year proved resilient, and labor markets are quite tight in many places. Energy and food prices have come down faster than expected from the war-induced peaks. And financial instability following the March banking turmoil remains contained thanks to forceful actions by the U.S. and Swiss authorities.

Stronger growth and lower inflation than expected are welcome news, suggesting the global economy is headed in the right direction. Yet growth remains low by historical standards, and while some adverse risks have moderated, the balance remains tilted to the downside, and it is too early to celebrate. There are growing signs that global activity is losing momentum. The global tightening of monetary policy has brought interest rates into contractionary territory. This has started to weigh down on activity, slowing the growth of credit to the nonfinancial sector, increasing households' and firms' interest payments, and putting pressure on real estate markets.

Second core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, remains well above central bank targets, and is expected to decline only gradually. In advanced economies, core inflation is expected to remain unchanged at 5.1 percent this year before declining to 3.1 percent in 2024. Clearly, the battle against inflation is not yet won.

Key to inflation's persistence will be labor market developments and wage profit dynamics. Despite tight labor markets, overall wage inflation has increased, but remains behind price inflation in most countries. The reason is simple and has little to do with so called greedflation. Prices adjust upwards faster than wages when nominal demand far exceeds what the economy can produce. As a result, real wages have declined. If labor markets remain strong, we should expect and welcome real wages recovering lost ground. Indeed the gap between nominal wage growth and price inflation has started to close. Because firms' profit margins have grown robustly in the last two years, we remain confident that there is room to accommodate the rebound in real wages without triggering a wage price spiral. With inflation expectations well-anchored in major economies and the economy slowing, market pressures should help contain the passthrough from labor cost to prices.""

In the medium term, overall economic growth is expected to slow down. Especially, developed economies are expected to face a slowdown in their economy, as the growth is expected to fall from 2.7% in 2022 to 1.5% in 2023. In comparison, the growth in developing economies and emerging markets is expected to remain stable at 4% in 2023 and 4.1% in 2024. According to the World Economic Forum’s Chief Economists' Outlook, the global economy seems gloomy. The majority of chief economists project moderate or strong growth in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia. Some of the most important economies in the world from the following regions include Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, India, and Japan.

How are Businesses Recovering?

After a long halt during the pandemic, companies from different sectors are making strong progress. Most importantly, it depends on the sector in which a company is operating. Some sectors have performed exceptionally well while some have been struggling. So far in 2023, the worst performing sectors have been healthcare, energy, and utilities. For instance, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) shares have plunged almost 30% since the start of the year, as of July 31. Whereas, consumer discretionary and technology have outperformed other sectors in the market. As we mentioned earlier, the tech sector is having a great time this year. Most investors are betting on tech stocks regardless of high inflation concerns. One of the main reasons why the tech sector has skyrocketed is the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) hype. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google is making massive progress in AI as the customers are highly interested in its cloud services. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai believes that in the long-term, AI will potentially expand Google's total addressable market and allow them to win new customers. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has some big tech competitors in AI including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

On July 28, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) released its earnings for the second quarter of 2023. The company posted earnings per share of $1.44, beating the expectations of $0.10. The company posted revenue of $74.60 billion and surpassed the consensus by $1.85 billion. Google continues to progress with its cloud business and advance in AI. With so much hope around Google's AI technology and future AI plans, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has soared 10% this week. During the Q2 2023 earnings call, the company made the following comments:

""The momentum across the Company drove our results this quarter. We delivered solid performance in Search and YouTube and ongoing strong growth in Cloud, where we remain focused on long-term value creation. And we continue our important work to operate more efficiently, creating durable savings to fund investments in our biggest priorities.

I’ll talk about this momentum, including our continued leadership in AI and our excitement about the evolution of Search. At I/O, we shared how we are making AI helpful for everyone in four important ways: first, improving knowledge and learning. This is our seventh year as an AI-first company, and we intuitively know how to incorporate AI into our products. Large language models make them even more helpful, models like PaLM 2 and soon Gemini, which we are building to be multimodal. These advances provide an opportunity to reimagine many of our products, including our most important product, Search. We are in a period of incredible innovation for Search, which has continuously evolved over the years. This quarter saw our next major evolution with the launch of the Search Generative Experience, or SGE, which uses the power of generative AI to make search even more natural and intuitive.

User feedback has been very positive so far. It can better answer the queries people come to us with today, while also unlocking entirely new types of questions that Search can answer. For example, we found that generative AI can connect the dots for people as they explore a topic or project, helping them weigh multiple factors and personal preferences before making a purchase or booking a trip. We see this new experience as another jumping off point for exploring the web, enabling users to go deeper to learn about a topic. I’m proud of the engineering excellence underlying our progress. Since the May launch, we’ve boosted serving efficiency, reducing the time it takes to generate AI snapshots by half. We’ll deliver even faster responses over time.

We have made good progress in data center machine efficiency, which will pay dividends as we continue to invest in AI. We continue to slow our expense growth and pace of hiring and ensure our teams are aligned to our highest priorities. This quarter, we reallocated a number of teams, including aligning Waze’s ad sales with our existing business organization. We are combining various engineering efforts across core infrastructure and cloud. Products like Bard and SGE are being built by small fast-moving teams that have been reallocated to these high-priority efforts. Overall, we are actively moving people to higher priority activities within the Company, and we continue to optimize our real estate footprint for current and future needs. Next, Google Cloud.

We see continued growth with Q2 revenue of $8 billion, up 28%, and operating profit of $395 million. Our AI-optimized infrastructure is a leading platform for training and serving generative AI models. More than 70% of gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers, including Cohere, Jasper, Typeface and many more. We provide the widest choice of AI supercomputer options with Google TPUs and advanced NVIDIA GPUs, and recently launched new A3 AI supercomputers powered by NVIDIA’s H100. This enables customers like AppLovin to achieve nearly 2 times better price performance than industry alternatives. Our new generative AI offerings are expanding our total addressable market and winning new customers. We are seeing strong demand for the more than 80 models, including third-party and popular open source in our Vertex, Search and Conversational AI platforms with a number of customers growing more than 15x from April to June.""

20 Worst Performing Economies in 2023

Our Methodology:

To find data for the 20 worst performing economies in 2023, our focus was on the economies with the lowest real GDP growth rate with annual percentage change. The real GDP growth rate reflects the economic growth of an economy expressing its GDP from one period to the next. We ranked the list from the IMF's database which tracks the real GDP growth rate. The economies with the same real GDP growth rate are differentiated based on their GDP at current prices, which was taken from the IMF's database of GDP at current prices. The country with lower GDP at current prices is ranked higher and so on. The list may not include countries such as Western Sahara, Syria, and Lebanon as their data is not available. The lists are then ranked in descending order of the aforementioned metric. Here are the 20 worst performing economies in 2023.

2023-07-31T17:18:49+00:00,AI 'driving' valuation growth for Big Tech stocks: Analyst,"Tech companies like AMD, Qualcomm, and NVIDIA are set to report earnings in August. Constellation Research Principal Analyst and Founder R ""Ray"" Wang joins Yahoo Finance Live to talk about what he calls ""MATANA"" stocks, also known as Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Alphabet, NVIDIA, and Amazon. Wang explains how ""AI is driving the valuation growth"" and how ""there was pre-Chat GPT and then post-Chat GPT,"" for these tech stocks.

Video Transcript

RACHELLE AKUFFO: So still confident in the MATANA stocks here. But as we talk about generative AI, what are the key differentiators in how these companies are mentioning and using it?

R ""RAY"" WANG: Yeah. There's a great difference between the folks that are actually using it, the folks that are actually producing it, and the folks that are supplying the tools to make it happen, right? And the tool makers, of course, are the Nvidia's of the world with the GBUs and of course, Google in the future with TPUs and then Microsoft if they get into the chip game. And then of course, we've got the companies that are actually doing the processing, which is in the cloud.

So you see that with Google, Amazon, Microsoft leading that way, and then you've got companies that are using it like Adobe, Oracle, ServiceNow and C3. Those are the ones that are creating this AI empire. And we do see that. AI is driving the valuation growth. We were dead in November 2022. There was pre-ChatGPT and then post ChatGPT. You could see the tech starts starting to grow. So that's the big thing.

But the second thing we discovered was ads are back for the few companies that are left and the ones that are actually growing, of course-- here's where Meta comes into play, Google comes into play, and what we'll be looking for is Amazon and Apple. Apple doesn't break out its advertising revenues, but Amazon is now the third largest digital ad player in the market.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: And we knew that there was this pull back in ad spending. Why do you think people are honing back into some of these stalwarts when it comes to eyes for consumers and ads?

Story continues

R ""RAY"" WANG: Rachelle, it's a great question. I think what happens is if you've got the network, you've got the power to reach out to folks, and there are very few mass marketing capabilities left. And so Amazon has amazing reach because of commerce, Google has amazing reach because of search, and of course, Alphabet or-- Alphabet has amazing reach because of search.

And then of course, we're seeing what's going on with Facebook because of the network effects on Meta. Now that also means other companies like Spotify, who are showing some growth. Yes, music isn't going to carry you all the way. Netflix subscriptions aren't going to carry all the way and you need to have multiple monetization models to be able to survive.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: And of course, we have to talk about the cloud, especially as we look at what happened with Microsoft's drop in cloud growth here. What is the story there? And how temporary is? Is this part of a new normal? A shift that we should expect when it comes to cloud.

R ""RAY"" WANG: Well, the reason I say it's cloudy times ahead is because we're seeing some interesting usage of the cloud. A lot of companies just took their stuff and put it onto the cloud and hoped it was going to get cheaper, but now a new class of CIOs are doing something different. They're taking cloud hosting costs and cloud operating costs from maybe $1,000 a month and getting it down to $100 a month.

And so we're about to see some rationalization and cloud usage just as of AI is picking up. And so we've got to see what happens if cloud contracts are coming down or if cloud usage is going to go down. And so Microsoft got through that. Amazon, we're going to watch very carefully on what their numbers are on August 3, and that will give us an indicator of what's going on. But Google didn't do too bad. They are flat at 28%. It is the summer, and we're going to see more pickup usually in the fall.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: And of course, we have to talk Apple whether it's becoming that $3 trillion stock or whether it's-- what they're doing with their own sort of chip making there. What are your expectations and have they really outperformed the way that you thought they would?

R ""RAY"" WANG: No, they've done really well given where the market is. There's an expectation that revenues are going to decline again in this quarter. It's been two quarters of decline, but we're still in a supercycle of refresh for iPhones, and it's not about the number of iPhone sales, and we won't see iPhone 15 sales if they make that announcement in the future. What this is about is how much can be made per iPhone. It's about the services revenue and Apple's story around that is very important. It's because they've been able to grow the revenue per device, and that's an important number to look at.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: And I want to talk Amazon as well because we've talked about cloud, especially when it comes to Microsoft there. But what about Amazon as well and the growth story there? Because I mean, we're hearing bits and bobs about their AI plans as well but not really as-- it's not really a big topic of conversation to the extent that we would have expected.

R ""RAY"" WANG: Yeah, so here's the interesting thing. There's been a lot of cost cutting at core Amazon. They've actually rejiggered their supply chains and their capacity and their warehouses, but they've improved the automation and what they're able to do now is deliver at a package or deliver any kind of parcel at a cost lower than anybody else, more automated than anyone else, and more track than anyone else, which means they can start using AI machine learning internally to drive down the cost.

And then the second piece is where is AWS growth? And AWS, right now, is actually winning among partner mindshares. Large partners are actually being embraced by AWS, which wasn't the case in the past, and they're seeing that level of growth that's very, very different than some of the other partnerships that we've seen in the cloud. So we're looking at those two factors-- core Amazon performance, and of course, what's going on with AWS.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ai-driving-valuation-growth-big-171849913.html,"['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'AMZ.F', 'AMZ.XETRA', 'AMZN.MX', 'AMZN.US', 'AMZO34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'GOGL34.SA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOG.MI', 'GOOG.MX', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US']",[],"{'polarity': 0.999, 'neg': 0.012, 'neu': 0.874, 'pos': 0.115}",Alphabet Inc

2023-07-31T16:59:35+00:00,20 Countries That Produce the Most Sugar,"In this article, we will discuss countries with the highest yield of sugar and their latest sugar production quantity. If you want to skip our analysis of the global sugar market and its impact on the economies of the world's biggest sugar producers, read 8 Countries That Produce The Most Sugar.

Brazil, India, and China lead the countries that produce the most sugar; these nations collectively make up 41% of the global production. If we talk about Brazil, its hold in the sugar industry is powered by expansive sugarcane fields and a favorable climate. However, a substantial portion of Brazil's sugarcane harvest is diverted to ethanol production due to government mandates and global biofuel demand. On the other end of the supply chain, the United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Cuba, and Malaysia are the Countries With The Highest Sugar Consumption.

The white, refined sugar we see comes from either sugar cane or sugar beet, the two sugar crops whose growth determines a country's ability to produce processed sugar. Sugarcane is native to tropical regions in South Asia and is the world's largest crop in production, with over 1.966 billion tons produced in the previous crop year. Once cut, the cane stalks are crushed to extract the juice, which is then purified and crystallized to produce raw sugar.

Intriguingly, sugar beet is a root crop that many don't presume is a source of sugar, but it very much is. Of the 20 countries that produce the most sugar, four heavily rely on sugar beet, namely the United States, Russia, Ukraine, and France, as the crop primarily grows in the cooler climates of the Northern Hemisphere.

Sugarcane is also the most consumed crop in the world, as its global consumption reached 1.966 billion tons in the crop year 2021/2022. Explore 15 Most Consumed Crops in the World to learn more about the most significant crops.

Global Sugar Market Overview

According to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global sugar market is $46.4 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $59.1 billion by 2028. The market will grow at a CAGR of 5% between 2023 and 2028, owing to increasing demand for processed food and beverages.

Story continues

The food and beverage industry is a significant consumer of raw sugar and affects market trends to a great extent. According to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), American youth consumes 143 calories from SSBs (sugar-sweetened beverages) daily, while the consumption is 145 calories for older people. If we talk about average sugar consumption (including beverages, refined sugar, etc.), American adults take 17 teaspoons of added sugar every day, which is 2-3 times higher than the recommended amount as per the American Heart Association.

While refined sugar's raw calories are associated with obesity and other health issues, it's imperative for the beverage and processed food industry. For instance, the Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are two titans of the beverage industry. The global market presence, along with a massive demand for sugar to produce their flagship carbonated drinks, means the purchasing decisions of Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) can significantly impact global sugar prices.

The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) offers over 500 brands in more than 200 countries and territories. As a major producer of sugar-sweetened beverages, the company's sugar procurement strategy and demand heavily influence global sugar prices and market trends. Likewise, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has multiple well-known brands like Pepsi, Mountain Dew, and Gatorade, among many others. So naturally, the company is one of the largest purchasers of sugar in the world.

Apart from the beverage industry, the confectionery industry also heavily relies on raw sugar. Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), the owner company of brands like Cadbury and Oreo, is a big stakeholder in the market. Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) reported net revenues of $31.496 billion in 2022, 9.6% higher than a year before. It's the well-loved brands like Milka, Trident, and Cadbury that drive Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) 's high sugar use.

The biofuel industry, specifically ethanol production, is another off-taker of raw sugar. Brazil, the world's largest sugar producer, channels a substantial portion of its sugarcane crop into ethanol production. As a result, companies like Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) are stakeholders in the sugar market. The rising demand for biofuels could stimulate increased sugar production and potentially higher prices.

Let's now list the top countries in sugar industry. 20 Countries That Produce the Most Sugar

20 Countries That Produce the Most Sugar

Our Methodology

We ranked the top 20 sugar producing countries according to their raw sugar yield in the crop year 2020/2021. Our source for this study was the Food and Agriculture Organization Of The United Nations (UN FAO). After shortlisting the nations leading in sugar production, we downloaded their raw sugar output stats from the UN FAO database by selecting the indicators of 'production quantity in 2020', as these are the latest records available.

Based on our findings, here are the 20 countries that produce the most sugar:

20. Ukraine

Annual Raw Sugar Production: 1.17 million metric tons

Ukraine is a top player in the global sugar market, and beet sugar is the main type produced. The country was estimated to produce approximately 1.17 million metric tons of sugar in the 2020/2021 crop year. A large part of Ukraine's agricultural sector is devoted to sugar beet cultivation because of its fertile soil conditions and favorable climate. Major regions for sugar beet cultivation include Poltava, Vinnytsia, and Khmelnytskyi.

19. Iran

Annual Raw Sugar Production: 1.56 million metric tons

Iran's sugar production primarily revolves around two crops: sugar beets and sugarcane. In 2020/21 crop year, the country produced over 1.56 million tonnes of sugar annually. Sugar beets are grown in the country's colder north, while sugarcane thrives in the hot and humid southern region. Sadly, Iran has been grappling with a water shortage that impacts sugar production.

18. Argentina

Annual Raw Sugar Production: 1.80 million metric tons

Argentina is renowned for its fertile Pampas grassland and has a long history of harvesting sugarcane. As a result, it sits amongst countries that produce the most sugar, with annual production exceeding 1.8 million tonnes. The subtropical provinces of Tucumán, Salta, and Jujuy are Argentina's main sugarcane cultivation areas, as they benefit from adequate rainfall and warmth. The Argentine sugar industry is heavily mechanized, focusing on producing bioethanol from sugarcane as an alternative energy source.

17. South Africa

Annual Raw Sugar Production: 2.10 million metric tons

South Africa's sugar industry is predominantly based in KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga provinces. The country ranks amongst 20 countries that produce the most sugar, owing to its around 24,000 registered sugarcane growers. South Africa cultivates about 19-20 million tonnes of sugarcane annually, then processed in 14 mills nationwide. Sugar production provides employment opportunities and facilitates infrastructural development.

16. Indonesia

Annual Raw Sugar Production: 2.123 million metric tons

Indonesia is one of the countries that produce the most sugar. It is also the fifth-largest sugar consumer in Asia; the country's sugar industry is centered in Java, where the climate favors sugarcane cultivation. However, regardless of its vast cultivation areas, Indonesia's sugar production is often insufficient to meet its domestic demand as there are inefficiencies in farming and processing.

15. Philippines

Annual Raw Sugar Production: 2.125 million metric tons

In the Philippines, sugar production is a vital industry supporting over five million people directly or indirectly. The country produces an average of 2.12 million metric tons of sugar annually, catering mostly to domestic consumption. The Philippines' sugar industry also significantly contributes to bioethanol production, as the Biofuels Act of 2006 mandates a minimum bioethanol blend in gasoline.

14. Colombia

Annual Raw Sugar Production: 2.21 million metric tons

Colombia produces approximately 2.2 million tons of sugar per year, and sugarcane is a significant cash crop. Much of this output is used for domestic consumption, while a sizable portion is converted into ethanol for biofuel.

13. Guatemala

Annual Raw Sugar Production: 2.65 million metric tons

Guatemala is one of the world's top sugar exporters, producing around 2.65 million tons of sugar annually. It's worth noting that the sector is heavily invested in modern technologies for irrigation, production, and energy co-generation from sugar cane waste.

12. Turkey

Annual Raw Sugar Production: 2.79 million metric tons

Turkey's sugar production is heavily based on sugar beet and has seen a shift due to governmental agricultural policies. Traditionally, state-run sugar factories dominated the industry, but liberalization since 2018 has allowed private enterprises to contribute significantly to the production. Turkey produced around 2.79 million tons of sugar during the last crop year, but its dependence on sugar imports to meet its domestic consumption needs signifies a production-demand gap.

11. Egypt

Annual Raw Sugar Production: 2.9 million metric tons

Egypt is among the top sugar-producing nations in Africa, as its annual production reaches almost 3 million tons. The sugar industry in Egypt has taken strides toward modernization and has invested significantly in upgrading machinery and refining processes. The government has also been working to ensure self-sufficiency and reduce dependence on imported sugar.

10. France

Annual Raw Sugar Production: 3.8 million metric tons

France is one of the biggest sugar producers in Europe, particularly of sugar beets, as they are well-suited to its temperate climate. The country's annual sugar production is 3.8 million tons, owing to its sugar beet yield. France has high-yielding sugar beet varieties, and its efficient, modern sugar refineries make the most of this crop. France's sugar industry also takes a sustainable approach as many producers use beet pulp and molasses, byproducts of sugar production, to make biofuels and animal feed.

9. Australia

Annual Raw Sugar Production: 4.33 million metric tons

Australia's Queensland and New South Wales areas boast a thriving sugar industry centered around sugar cane production. The nation produced over 4.33 million tons of raw sugar in 2020/2021 and became one of the largest sugar producing countries. Most Australian sugar farms are often located in coastal areas and make use of the tropical climate that is necessary for sugar cane growth.

Dividend investing stands as a highly significant investment strategy for generating reliable and stable cash flow. Over the years, dividend stocks demonstrated their ability to outperform the broader market on several occasions. This makes them an attractive choice for investors seeking both income and potential long-term growth. Moreover, dividend stocks have represented a significant portion of overall market returns. We also reported Hartford Fund’s data which revealed that dividends have accounted for approximately 41% of the index's total return on average from 1930 to 2022.

Though investors favored tech growth stocks in early 2023, analysts believe that dividend stocks may make a comeback due to the potential for a mild recession. On July 18, Bank of America released a global fund manager survey indicating that sentiment has turned more bearish. The majority consensus is now leaning towards a mild recession in the last quarter of 2023. The main concerns cited by respondents include potential risks related to inflation, policy mistakes, and a credit crunch. To navigate this bearish sentiment, analysts advise adding dividend-paying stocks to portfolios as these stocks historically perform better during economic downturns compared to non-dividend ones.

Dividend stocks are not completely recession-proof, but they tend to be more stable compared to high-growth or speculative stocks when the economy is going through a downturn. Last year’s bear market also showed a strong outperformance of dividend stocks in comparison with other asset classes. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat index declined by 6.47% in 2022, whereas the S&P 500 recorded its worst performance since 2008, falling by over 19%. Investors often pay attention to companies that have raised their dividends for long periods of time rather than those with high yields. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend stocks because of their continuous commitment to shareholders for decades.

When speaking about economic downturns, these periods can negatively impact investor confidence, leading to widespread selling across various stocks and causing some to become oversold. Relative Strength Index, introduced by J. Welles Wilder Jr. in 1978, is a popular technical analysis indicator used to measure the speed and change of price movements of a stock. The RSI is calculated based on the average gains and losses over a specific period, typically 14 trading days. However, this period can be adjusted depending on the trader's preference. In this article, we have compiled a list of oversold stocks based on 14-day RSI levels as of July 30. 11 Oversold Dividend Stocks to Invest In

How Value Investors Can Use the Power of Compounding

Welcome to Episode #337 of the Value Investor Podcast.

(1:00) - Tracey’s Top Investing Books (3:45) - What Can Compounding Do For Your Long Term Investments? (7:15) - The Strongest Performers Since 2000: Should You Be Adding Them To Your Portfolio? (19:30) - Episode Roundup: V, COST, TSCO, ANSS, CMG Podcast@Zacks.com

Every week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.

On July 24, 2023, Stocktwits sent out a tweet with a list of the 10 best performing S&P 500 stocks since 2000. The names on the list weren't necessarily what you might think. While 2 of the ""Magnificent 7"" were on the list, that meant the others were not.

The list reflected the last 23 years. That's a long time to hold, and compound, a stock. Compounding is usually associated with value investors, like Warren Buffett, because it's value investors which are normally long-term investors.

But what about valuation? None of the Magnificent 7 are cheap.

Should you buy a company at any price if you intend to hold it for a long time? Some on Twitter have argued that valuation is irrelevant. Look at Visa and Costco. Neither have been cheap but they have been good long-term performers.

Does Valuation Matter in Long-Term Investing?

1.       Tractor Supply Co. TSCO

Investors might be surprised to see Tractor Supply as the third best performer in the S&P 500 since 2000. Since Jan 4, 2000 to July 24, 2023, Tractor Supply is up 18,980%.

Story continues

Earnings of Tractor Supply are expected to rise 7% in 2023 and 10% in 2024. You're not getting the shares dirt cheap today, however, as it has a forward P/E of 20.5. And with that earnings growth, it has a PEG of 2.3.

Should Tractor Supply still be on the value investor's shortlist?

2.       Ansys Inc. ANSS

Ansys is a software company that specializes in engineering simulation. Ansys didn't join the S&P 500 until 2017 but it is now the 8th best performing S&P 500 stock since 2000. From Jan 4, 2000 to July 24, 2023, Ansys is up 13,162%.

Earnings of Ansys are expected to rise 7.6% in 2023 and 11.6% in 2024. But you'll pay a high price for those earnings as it has a forward P/E of 40 and a PEG ratio of 8.

Is it too late for value investors to get into Ansys?

3.       Visa Inc. V

Visa did not make the S&P 500 best performers list. It went IPO in 2008 and shares are up 1,363% during that time.

Earnings of Visa are expected to jump 15.2% in fiscal 2023 and another 12.8% in fiscal 2024. Shares have always been expensive. At the IPO, it was trading at 40x and in 2021, when shares hit new highs, it was trading at 51x. But it's gotten cheaper. Visa currently trades with a forward P/E of 27 and a PEG of 1.8.

Should value investors keep an eye on Visa?

4.       Costco Wholesale Corp. COST

Costco didn't make the S&P 500 best performers list either, even though it's a fan favorite both of shoppers and investors. Shares of Costco are up 1,052% from Jan 4, 2000 to July 24, 2023.

Earnings of Costco are expected to rise 9.7% in fiscal 2023 and another 6.9% in fiscal 2024. But is that good enough? Costco is expensive, with a forward P/E of 39.2 and a PEG ratio of 4.7.

For value investors, is it time to concede you will never own Costco?

5.       Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG

Chipotle Mexican Grill also did not make the list of the top 10 best performing S&P 500 stocks. It went IPO in Jan 2006 and promptly rose 100% on its first day of trading. Chipotle hasn't been a cheap stock since. Shares of Chipotle are up 4,404% since the IPO.

Earnings of Chipotle are expected to soar 34.5% in 2023 and rise another 20% in 2024. Shares have come down off recent all-time highs so its PEG ratio is just 1.3. That looks more attractive than its forward P/E, which is 42.7.

If Chipotle shares weaken further, will value investors take a look?

2023-07-31T16:20:00+00:00,Cisco: How an Initiative Developed by a Nonprofit Helps First Responders Respond to the Autistic Community,"NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / July 31, 2023 / Cisco Systems Inc.  Cisco Systems Inc., Monday, July 31, 2023, Press release picture

This blog was contributed to by Mizpah Brown-Rich, the co-founder of Joshua's Gift.

Of all the concerns that parents of autistic children face, a scary encounter with police shouldn't be one of them. But that's exactly what Joshua's parents dealt with, following a walk around the block with their son Joshua to help calm his anxiety.

At the time, Joshua was 17 years old, 6-feet tall, African American, and non-verbal. Joshua interacted with the world around him a little differently than others.

When a neighborhood resident called the police for what they mistook as ""suspicious behavior"", the resulting response could have easily escalated into a dangerous situation.

The experience inspired Joshua's parents to take bold action to help ensure that police, security personnel, and first responders could learn how to identify autistic individuals and respond with skill and compassion.

Joshua's mother Mizpah Brown-Rich and father Kerry Rich developed CODE JOSHUA - a unique call for emergency assistance that alerts police officers, firefighters, health care workers, and other personnel to respectfully approach and respond to autistic individuals in crisis with sensitivity and caution. The initiative is one of many innovations and services within their non-profit organization Joshua's Gift, which works to develop a society that invitingly accepts, respects, and includes the autistic community.

According to Autismspectrumnews.org, caregivers report 13% of their autistic children used at least one emergency service in a two-month period, and 20% of autistic children have had encounters with law enforcement officers by the age of 2. By creating an alliance with first responders, CODE JOSHUA drives equal rights, protects and defends our most vulnerable citizens, and preserves individual freedoms.

Cisco's Connected Black Professionals (CBP) Inclusive Community recognized the power and potential of CODE JOSHUA and the alignment with our social justice action committed to supporting key organizations in shaping social justice policy and driving equal rights. CBP nominated the innovative program for Cisco's Black Equity Grant program, which awards a total of US $500,000 in cash grants each fiscal year to Black-serving and/or Black-led nonprofit organizations who support social justice and racial equity.

Story continues

As Curshanda Cusseaux Woods, Black Equity Grant program administrator, puts it, ""Joshua's Gift is a wonderful example of the types of organizations we love to support. They align with our social justice values and have the vision and the know how to institute change. They just needed support from Cisco to further their impact in more communities.""

With Cisco's funding, support, and community partnership, CODE JOSHUA was established into a robust registry database. Profiles created by the families of autistic individuals detail key information and crisis behaviors to help guide 911 dispatchers in appropriate crisis response. The initiative includes a training program and video resources to train first responders on how to approach with empathy and patience, how to de-escalate the situation by meeting the individuals' sensory and communication needs, and how to respond without force.

To date, CODE JOSHUA has been launched in police departments in multiple Northern California counties.

Joshua's mother Mizpah is seeing real impact. ""Our CODE JOSHUA training courses are having an impressive impact on the first responders we are training. The program is effectively helping minimize anxiety and eliminate potential harm to our loved ones living with autism and IDD (Intellectual Developmental Disabilities). ""By partnering with Cisco, we can leverage their technology and expertise to reach more communities and raise awareness about our autistic citizens. Together, we are making a difference in saving lives and creating a more inclusive and respectful society.""

2023-07-31T11:00:23+00:00,5 AI Stocks Poised for Growth Without Sky-High Risk,"This article is an excerpt from the InvestorPlace Digest newsletter. To get news like this delivered straight to your inbox, click here.

Last week, I revealed a list of the five top “moonshot” artificial intelligence (AI) stocks from across InvestorPlace.com.

Not only are these elite companies the leaders in their field, but their relatively low valuations also make them far likelier to succeed.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

As the 1999 tech bubble reminds us, it’s the smaller startups and turnarounds that end up trouncing the incumbents. (Consider how underdog Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) outperformed blue-chip Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) during that period!)

But not every investor can shoulder the volatility of the riskiest moonshot bets.

Companies like C3.ai (NASDAQ:AI) and Sabre (NASDAQ:SABR) from last week’s letter are highly unprofitable. Meanwhile, those like GitLab (NASDAQ:GTLB) will require years of hypergrowth to reach their full potential.

Buying only a few shares of these moonshot companies limits the potential profit to investors.

That’s why I’m revealing another five artificial intelligence bets from our writers at InvestorPlace.com.

These firms are mostly larger, have lower volatility, and are still benefiting from artificial intelligence tailwinds.

5 AI Stocks Poised for Growth: Adobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.

Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) presents a challenge for investors. The graphics software firm is highly attractive for its profitability. Its 20% return on capital invested (ROIC) makes it five times more profitable than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) by that metric.

But on the other hand, the company’s high quality comes with an equally high stock price.

Shares of the California-based firm trade at 32X forward earnings, well above the 20X median for all S&P 500 companies. The average Wall Street analyst gives Adobe only a 5% upside relative to current prices.

Fortunately, this will change as Adobe’s AI offerings grow.

Story continues

As Samuel O’Brient notes in his recent article “25 Millionaire-Maker AI Stocks to Buy Now:”

The AI boom should give investors and analysts even more reason to embrace ADBE stock…

It is incorporating generative AI into its well-known products [which] will likely make it an even more popular tool among graphic design professionals and other creatives who depend upon it.

That will put Adobe on a new growth path.

Media firms are increasingly turning to generative AI to help create content, and Adobe’s lead in the industry gives it a distinct advantage over competitors like Avid Technology (NASDAQ:AVID) that have fewer AI capabilities.

As AI adoption accelerates, so too will Adobe’s ability to grow.

2. Intel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.

“No words can portray or explain the historic collapse of Intel,” David Moadel noted in a recent article.

America’s largest chipmaker – Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) – is now expected to generate only $2.46 billion in profits this year, down from $21 billion in 2019. Intense competition from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is also keeping prices low, especially in server-related chips.

Still, Moadel suspects that Intel is about to turn a corner:

Opportunities to ride along with a zero-to-hero stock don’t come along every day. The sentiment surrounding Intel is tepid at best right now. However, that could instantly change.

That’s because Intel is quietly pushing ahead with AI applications.

Last week, the firm announced it would offer 34 open-source AI reference kits, the result of a years-long collaboration with consulting firm Accenture (NYSE:ACN). The firm also plans on introducing chips specific to AI use by 2025, codenamed “Falcon Shores.”

Intel announced better-than-expected earnings on Thursday, July 27, suggesting that its cost-cutting measures are finally working.

Most importantly, Intel’s cheap share price leaves plenty of room for upside.

Shares of the struggling chipmaker are down 50% since 2021 and only trade at 16X 2025 earnings.

If Intel succeeds in turning its business around, it could look much like Apple in the early 2000s: A fallen giant ready to surge again.

3. Meta Platforms (META) Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.

In February, Luke Lango suddenly turned bullish on Facebook parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and other big-tech stocks:

Now’s the time to buy Big Tech stocks. That’s just what you do with long-term winners. You sell them when they are overhyped and undervalued. You buy them when they are underappreciated and undervalued.

It was a tactical trade. Big-tech firms had just sold off, and their valuations had become irresistible.

This week, Dana Blankenhorn joined Luke in recommending Meta, thanks to the tech giant’s newfound strength in artificial intelligence:

Meta’s efforts in generative artificial intelligence (AI), where it has open-sourced key technologies, are also a contrast to other [cloud companies], which have urged government regulation to control the software…

Its dominant position providing free services in the developing world has proven more powerful than any missteps with Threads or the metaverse. I admit I underestimated it.

Meta also recently announced it would give its “Llama 2” large language model away for free, upsetting a standing rivalry between OpenAI and Google. This now puts Meta in the running for AI applications.

Finally, Meta’s shares remain inexpensive compared to other “Magnificent Seven” stocks.

The company trades at 19X 2025 earnings, well below Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) at 26X, Apple at 29X and Amazon at 49X.

Though the firm has less upside than last week’s “moonshot” picks, Meta’s stability and constant cash generation makes it a safer bet on AI than most.

4. Palantir (PLTR) A close-up shot of a hand on a screen with the Palantir (PLTR) logo.

In 1994, consulting firm Accenture formed its Business Process Management unit to help companies outsource work.

It was a hit.

Within a decade, the management consulting firm had transformed into a service company focused on implementation. Today, Accenture is a $200 billion behemoth in tech and cloud-based outsourcing.

Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) could soon walk the same path.

The $36 billion data analytics company focuses on helping governments and large enterprises manage, secure and analyze data. If the U.S. Army needs help creating an AI-enabled system, they’re more likely to turn to Palantir than attempt to build one from scratch.

This week, Faisal Humayun writes how he expects bullish momentum to be sustainable for Palantir and that AI applications could add further growth. InvestorPlace.com writer Larry Ramer also notes that well-respected analyst Dan Ives now calls Palantir an “unmatched… AI fortress” and has a $25 price target.

That said, Palantir still has a lot of work to do in AI.

The company doesn’t yet have deep in-house AI capabilities. Its platforms mostly involve data gathering and analysis. Ramer also notes how he has “seen no evidence of Palantir investing a significant amount of funds in developing AI before 2023.”

Nevertheless, Accenture’s experience shows that it’s not always necessary to have every platform in-house. If Palantir can develop its sales teams to mirror those of consulting firms, Dan Ives’ bullish calls will likely prove correct.

5. DigitalOcean (DOCN) A laptop screen displays the logo for DigitalOcean (DOCN).

Finally, Bret Kenwell writes this week how DigitalOcean (NYSE:DOCN) is now a “buy” following its acquisition of Paperspace, an AI cloud computing startup.

Here’s how CEO Yancey Spruill explains the acquisition:

The demand for AI/ML cloud solutions has witnessed an unprecedented surge, fueled by the emergence of large language models (LLMs)…

Together, DigitalOcean and Paperspace will unlock opportunities… [that will] delve into AI/ML applications such as generative media, text analysis, natural language understanding, recommendation engines, and image classifications.

Even before the acquisition, DigitalOcean was a highly cash-flow positive firm. The New York-based company helps small and medium-sized businesses migrate to the cloud with virtual private servers (VPS). These scalable servers are a profitable business. Analysts were already expecting a strong $173 million profit in 2023.

The move into generative AI now gives DigitalOcean greater room for growth, especially if demand for pretrained systems begin to rise.

Kenwell currently has a $44-$45 floor price target on DOCN and expects shares to rise as high as $53 in the near term.

The AI Revolution Is Here

In 1983, the Pew Research Foundation found that middle-income families held 32% of U.S. wealth.

Fast forward to today, and everything’s changed. Middle-income families now own 17% of wealth and earn less than half of the country’s aggregate income.

Meanwhile, the share owned by upper-income families has skyrocketed to almost 80%, turning America into a land of “haves” and “have-nots.”

Eric Fry calls this the Technochasm.

It’s a widening gulf between those who have benefited from technological change and those that have suffered or even been replaced.

The trend is accelerating with artificial intelligence. We’re seeing thousands of jobs getting replaced by generative AI. International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) alone has already announced 7,800 cuts.

And the better that artificial intelligence gets, the faster the trend will happen.

That’s why Louis Navellier, Eric and Luke teamed up and held the AI Impact Event on Thursday.

During the event, they discussed the consequences of AI rapid adaptation… and the huge opportunity that we have if we act right now.

Plus, Louis, Eric, and Luke shared how investors can position themselves to prosper.

If you missed the event, you can catch the replay here.

Dow Stocks to Buy: Merck (MRK) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks

Source: shutterstock.com/CC7

From a pure potential perspective, Merck (NYSE:MRK) stock offers a lot to investors. Past returns might not be an absolute indicator of future performance. However, they tend to be a reasonable indicator given that strong firms usually tend to continue to do well. Merck is particularly attractive for that reason. Over the past 10 years, its stock has returned 13.02% annually. That’s roughly 149% better than the average stock during the same period.

Further, Merck continues to offer upside currently. Wall Street analysts believe there’s about 20% upside in MRK hares beyond their current price. Not convinced yet? Well, it also includes a dividend that hasn’t been reduced since 1985 that adds an additional 2.75% return to its shares.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Revenues have slowed slightly of late at the firm. However, Merck has grown faster than every other large-cap pharmaceutical firm in the U.S. over the past 3 years with the exception of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). Strip out Pfizer’s extraordinary Covid-19 windfall and Marck may have been the outright leader.

Dow Stocks to Buy: Apple (AAPL) A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.

Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.com

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has contributed heavily to the 2023 turnaround in markets. Better, investors expect Apple shares to hold value due to the ubiquity of its products and an expectation it will continue to thrive.

That notion is primarily related to the continued strength of iPhone sales. Apple sold $51.33 billion worth of iPhones during the most recent quarter. That was a record for the company and is part of the reason Apple shares continue to surge even as overall revenues continue to sag. The explanation is simple: Investors understand that Apple has figured out how to create and market products that have such mass appeal that quarterly fluctuations are hardly a concern.

Story continues

The company can find revenues elsewhere in the short term as it is doing with services. However, the real reason to buy in now is that Apple is on the cusp of its first new product release in a decade with Apple Vision Pro and new markets for legacy products, particularly India.

Dow Stocks to Buy: JPMorgan (JPM) tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocks

Source: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.com

JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock continues to look better and better in the aftermath of the banking crisis. It is now old news that JPMorgan took over First Republic, acting as an anchor to the U.S. banking system.

However, that notion is worth examining again because it means JPMorgan has extended its dominant position in the U.S. banking sector. And when big firms get bigger that’s generally a reasonable time to consider investing. JPMorgan is certainly bigger now than it was a year ago so it is the tie to invest. Revenues increased by 34%, reaching $41.3 billion. The bank was able to derive $14.47 billion in net income from that which represented a 67% increase year-over-year.

The company gained First Republic’s wealth banking business from the takeover. That will allow the company to cater better to wealthy coastal clientele. Meanwhile, JPMorgan is currently also benefiting from surging interest income as it lends more through credit cards to cash-strapped Americans unwilling or unable to cut back on spending.

Honeywell (HON) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks

Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com

Honeywell (NYSE:HON) is perhaps not the most exciting stock on this list but it does offer investors a reasonable amount of upside potential over the next few years. The firm serves a wide swath of the economy and firms through industrial software.

There’s a lot of potential in that area for the company especially given that Honeywell is deeply connected to the building technologies sector. The opportunity to drive revenues from the emerging IoT opportunity gives Honeywell strong future prospects and growth paths.

However, Honeywell hasn’t been growing much lately. Its 3-year 1.1% revenue growth rate of 1.1% is worse than average for its sector. Honeywell is expected to grow faster than that this year and next. That should correlate to increasing share prices as markets will appreciate the growth and Honeywell’s IoT potential. Investors can also expect rising earnings as top-line results improve in 2023 and through 2024. It is a solid stock worth owning over that period.

Nike (NKE) A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneath

Source: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.com

The bull case for investing in Nike (NYSE:NKE) stock is fairly straightforward right now. For those who believe that the brand’s power matters, there’s a lot of upside in initiating a position at this moment.

Nike is the largest sports brand by market capitalization. It is far ahead of the next closest competitor and even farther ahead of Adidas, the nearest shoe seller. That ranking does not look to be changing any time soon and that suggests that as Nike works through its current problems it will emerge more valuable on the other side due to its position.

Nike products continue to sell well with sales increasing by 8% during the most recent quarter. However, the firm has been impacted by a combination of higher costs and markdowns that sent net income falling by 28% during the same timeframe.

It should be as simple as that for investors: If you believe Nike is capable of working through the kinks and ironing out its operations it’s a great time to buy given that sales continue to grow.

Microsoft (MSFT) a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buy

Source: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.com

The outlook for an already strong Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is getting stronger. Microsoft has done extraordinarily well in 2023 due primarily to AI. The company invested heavily in to ChatGPT and emerged as the clear leader when generative AI exploded earlier this year.

At that time, Microsoft’s outlook improved because the integration of AI into its products expanded its overall market. That wasn’t the end, though. More recently, Microsoft announced aggressive pricing for some of its AI products. The announcement leads to the possibility of even higher revenues than previously expected making MSFT shares even more attractive.

It’s difficult to ignore Microsft, frankly. It has Microsft 365 office products, Azure cloud, a large stake in OpenAI, and a track record of winning for such a long time that it almost gets ignored when it continues to win. On top of that, Microsoft gets to merge with Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) improving its gaming industry standing and carving a deeper path for dominance in that burgeoning sector.

Cisco (CSCO) image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocks

Source: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.com

I believe Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock should appeal to a certain type of tech investor currently. The company focuses on networking and things like internet protocol products and services. It is a leader in its sector but isn’t considered among the tech giants by any means. That’s where I want to start regarding Cisco as an opportunity.

At some point, tech investors will diversify away from the magnificent 7 and into less volatile tech. With a beta of 0.99, Cisco is among the least volatile tech stocks available. It’s a safer bet on tech growth and one that investors worried about ongoing concentration in the tech sector might consider.  If you want to diversify out of those mega names, Cisco is a reasonable choice.

It will likely grow by 10% this year. That’s not bad at all. It isn’t Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) style explosive growth but the flipside is that Cisco offers a dividend yielding 3.04% currently. That’s quite high within the tech sector and serves to make Cisco’s returns significantly higher overall.

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), Comcast Corporation (CMCSA) and Intuit Inc. (INTU). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>

Tesla shares have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the past six months (+46.6% vs. +32.1%). In the last reported quarter, the electric vehicle (EV) giant witnessed record production, deliveries and revenues. We expect deliveries to see an annualized growth of around 36% in 2023.

Production ramp-up at gigafactory 4 (in Berlin) and 5 (in Austin) and introduction of new models, including Semi and Cybertruck, are set to support long-term deliveries growth. The Zacks analyst anticipates automotive revenues to rise more than 18% this year. Additionally, Tesla’s energy generation and storage revenues outlook is promising.

Falling debt levels and solid potential of its charging business are other positives. While shrinking margins remain a near-term concern, we expect Tesla to deliver outsized returns in the long run on the back of output ramp-up and introduction of new models.

(You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>>)

Shares of Comcast have outperformed the Zacks Cable Television industry over the past year (+24.9% vs. +4.5%). The company is benefiting from a growing wireless subscriber base as witnessed in the second quarter of 2023. Comcast’s plan to transition to DOCSIS 4.0 is noteworthy. The technology will help it in expanding much faster and at a lower cost compared to competitors.

Recovery in park and movie business bodes well for Comcast’s profitability. Its streaming service Peacock is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy.

However, Comcast persistently suffers from video-subscriber attrition due to cord cutting. Moreover, broadband prospects are suffering from increased competition from fixed wireless as well as fiber. Additionally, a leveraged balance sheet is a major concern.

Shares of Intuit have gained +15.4% over the past year against the Zacks Computer - Software industry’s gain of +24.7%. The company is benefiting from strong momentum in online ecosystem revenues and solid professional tax revenues. The TurboTax Live offering is also driving growth in the Consumer tax business.

Solid momentum in the company’s lending product, QuickBooks Capital, remains a positive. Moreover, the company’s strategy of shifting its business to cloud-based subscription model will help generate stable revenues over the long run.

Nonetheless, macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds might significantly hurt small businesses operations, thereby posing risks for Intuit’s top-line growth. Additionally, higher costs and expenses due to increased investments in marketing and engineering teams are likely to continue impacting bottom-line results in the near term.

2023-07-31T18:00:47+00:00,Jim Cramer’s 10 S&amp;P 500 Stock Picks for 2023,"In this article, we discuss Jim Cramer's 10 S&P 500 stock picks for 2023. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Jim Cramer's 5 S&P 500 Stock Picks for 2023.

The S&P 500 was under immense pressure in 2022, going down by 19.4% as most of its listings crumbled amid the push by the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates. Inflation near record highs meant few investors had the stomach to take up risk in the equity markets, all but fueling the selloff. Recession fears and the Russian-Ukraine war all but accelerated the selloff spree. Amid the bearish sentiments in the market, CNBC's Jim Cramer was overly concerned over whether the market will bounce back amid the steep selloff.

The Federal Reserve embarking on an aggressive monetary tightening spree in the race to clamp down on inflationary pressures that were getting out of hand spelled more trouble, according to Cramer. Amid the interest hiking spree, the CNBC commentator warned of the potential recession risk that could significantly affect investors' sentiments.

The warnings did not come as a surprise as Cramer tends to be bearish on the market and its prospects regardless of the ongoings. While he has been a staple of the financial news industry for decades, Cramer sometimes gets things wrong, which has seen him become the laughingstock of Wall Street. Given that his predictions are often controversial, with a portion of them turning out wrong, some investors often shun them or opt to do the opposite of what he does.

The fact that some of Cramer’s predictions rarely come to fruition has led to the creation of a Twitter account called Inverse Jim Cramer. The account is best known for taking the opposite position on Cramer's financial decisions about the stock market.

Chevron was one of Cramer’s top picks at the start of the year. He insisted it was becoming cheaper and cheaper as it went down. The CNBC Mad Money host reiterated that the stock would be a winner as long as oil prices stayed above the $60-a barrel level. However, that has not been the case, as the stock has already lost more than 9% in market value and remains under pressure.

One prediction that Cramer might want to forget sooner than later is that of Silicon Valley bank parent company SVB Financials. While making the prediction, the CNBC commentator reiterated that it will be one of the biggest winners of 2023 alongside other blue-chip stocks like Tesla and Meta.

“This company is a merchant bank with a deposit base that Wall Street has mistakenly been concerned by,” Cramer said in the clip.

That prediction came to bite as Silicon Valley Bank went under at the height of the banking crisis that I regional banks. Jim Cramer's 10 S&P 500 Stock Picks for 2023

Nevertheless, Cramer is sometimes wrong, and whenever he gets it right, there is always something to smile about. Despite getting it wrong with Chevron and SVB Financials, Cramer also reiterated that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) as some of the best stocks to consider in 2023. True to his predictions, the stocks have lived up to expectations and emerged as key drivers of the overall bull market.

Even though the overall market is trading well above its recent lows, plenty of stocks are trading less than they were a year ago. Some of these stocks boast impressive risk-reward given the tremendous upside potential. As valuation concerns become a big issue after the massive rally year to date, CNBCs Cramer believes there are stocks likely to fair well even on the economy plunging into recession.

Our Methodology

The list of Jim Cramer's 10 S&P 500 stock picks for 2023 takes into considerations stock picks that the CNBC’s commentator predicted will outperform the market in 2023 at the start of the year. He chose five stocks from each of the groups of the highest and lowest performers in the S&P 500 in 2022 that might be winners in 2023.

While some of the stocks have lived up to expectations and rallied significantly others have been a big disappointment. We ranked the stocks based on their gains from when Cramer made his predictions. Overall, an equal weighted portfolio of these 10 stocks returned nearly 25% year-to-date and outperformed the S&P 500 Index.

10. V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC)

Upside Potential: 21.30%

Gain since Cramer Prediction: -29%

Price to earnings multiple: 9

V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) is a big miss in Cramer’s predictions. The CNBC commentator expected the company to bounce back while betting that the new interim CEO Benno Dorer will help reinvigorate the company's fortunes. However that has not been the case as the stock is down by 29% year to date.

V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC)'s growth metrics have mostly been cut short by inflation and other macro headwinds. Intermittent lockdowns in China last year and currency headwinds have also affected its revenue base. Consequently, the stock is down by about 29% year to date.

Consequently, V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) is trading with a price-to-earnings multiple of 9 compared to 26 for the S&P 500. In addition, analysts on Wall Street have a $23.86 price target on the stock implying a 21.30% upside potential.

9. Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH)

Upside Potential: 38.98%

Gain since Cramer Prediction: -23%

Price to earnings multiple: 34

Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) has been a big disappointment as it is down by about 23% year to date. The underperformance comes against the backdrop of Cramer terming the energy company a renewable golden boy at the beginning of the year.

The company designs, develop, manufactures, and sells home energy solution for the solar photovoltaic industry. While it has underperformed the overall market, Cramer believes the company remains well positioned to benefit from the clean energy push in the US.

The company delivered impressive Q2 results with revenues increasing 34.1%  to $711.1 million despite missing estimates of $727 million.  The bottom line increased 37.4% to $1.47 a share beating consensus estimates of $1.27 a share.

The stock trades at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 34 compared to an average of 26 for S&P 500. The average price target on the stock is $240.94, implying a 38.94% upside potential from current levels.

8. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)

Upside Potential: 11.90%

Gain since Cramer Prediction: -13%

Price to earnings multiple: 20

Cramer believes Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is one of the best defense contractors as the Russia-Ukraine war persists. The company operates as an aerospace and defense company providing aircraft systems workwise. It delivered impressive Q1 results with earnings of $5.50 a share against $5.09 a share expected on revenues of $9.3 billion against the $9.2 billion that Wall Street expected.

Early in the year Cramer touted Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE:NOC) as one of the best defense contractors as the Russia-Ukraine war persists. However, that has not been the case as the stock has underperformed going by the 13% decline year to date.

While Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) has been under pressure going down by 13% year to date, it's been under consolidation in recent months. Likewise, it trades at a discount with a price-to-earnings multiple of 20 compared to 26 for the S&P 500. The average price target on the stock is $511.55, repressing an 11.90% upside potential from current levels.

7. Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL)

Upside Potential: 19.08%

Gain since Cramer Prediction: 1.03%

Price to earnings multiple: 12

At the start of the year Cramer predicted Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) will have a multiyear rally. However that has not been the case as it is only up by about 1% year to date compared to an 18% gain for the S&P 500.

Nevertheless, the company's sentiments have improved significantly, going by the 35% rally over the past two months. The rally has come at the back of an uptick in energy prices.

Expectations that oil prices will find support above the $80 a barrel level strengthens the oil field services company's outlook. The provider of products and services for the energy industry is likely to benefit from the booming energy industry by year-end.

Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) already exhibits strong financial metrics with earnings per share of $2.16, operating margin of 16.21%, and return on invested capital of 15.61%. While trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 12, Haliburton boasts of a solid 1.67% dividend yield

Cramer predicts that Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) has a multiyear rally ahead as the average price target is $45.50, implying a 19.08% upside potential from current levels.

6. McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK)

Upside Potential: 11.69%

Gain since Cramer Prediction: 7.4%

Price to earnings multiple: 15

McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) is one stock that Cramer believes will do well even with the economy slowing down amid recession fears. However that has not been the case as the stock has underperformed on the overall market turning bullish. Its 7% gain is an understatement going by the 18% gain for the S&P 500 over the same period.

McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) is already up by about 7% but boasts tremendous upside potential owing to its low valuation and long-term growth potential. Over the past three years, it has delivered over 400% return. It's fresh from increasing its dividend by 15%, affirming its ability to generate strong cash flows.

The stock trades at a discount with a price-to-earnings multiple of 15, backed with a 0.60% dividend yield. With an average price target of $451, McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) has an 11.69% upside potential from current levels.

2023-07-31T21:57:00+00:00,Advanced Micro Devices Q2 Preview: Time to Buy?,"It’s the busiest week of earnings season, with an extensive list of companies scheduled to unveil their quarterly results.

There are several notable names on the reporting docket, including the highly-followed Advanced Micro Devices AMD. AMD shares have been big-time outperformers in 2023 so far, up more than 70% following a brutal 2022 showing.

But how does the semiconductor titan stack up heading into its quarterly release? Let’s take a closer look at expectations and results from a few other chip players, including NXP Semiconductors NXPI and Intel INTC, as a light guide.

Intel

Intel posted better-than-expected Q2 results, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 420%. Quarterly revenue totaled $12.9 billion, 8% ahead of expectations and down from the year-ago quarter.

The market took the results in stride, with Intel shares finding plenty of buyers post-earnings. Impressively, both top and bottom line results exceeded the higher end of previous guidance. Zacks Investment Research

NXP Semiconductors

NXP Semiconductors also posted better-than-expected top and bottom line results, exceeding EPS expectations by 5% and delivering a 3% revenue beat. Similar to INTC, the company’s revenue results were at the high end of previous guidance, undoubtedly a positive.

And the market took the results well, with NXPI shares seeing bullish activity post-earnings. Zacks Investment Research

Advanced Micro Devices

Analysts have been silent for the quarter to be reported over the last several months, with the $0.57 per share estimate unchanged. The value reflects a 45% pullback in earnings from the year-ago quarter. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

The story remains primarily the same regarding the top line, with the $5.3 billion quarterly estimate down a fractional 0.1% since the beginning of May. Sales are forecasted to decline along with earnings, with the estimate suggesting an 18% pullback year-over-year.

Story continues Zacks Investment Research

In addition, AMD has been a consistent earnings performer as of late, exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations in nine of its last ten releases. Just in its latest print, AMD delivered a 7% EPS beat paired with a modest revenue surprise.

It’s worth noting that the market has been impressed with the last two releases, with AMD shares seeing notable bullish momentum post-earnings. This is illustrated by the green arrows circled in the chart below. Zacks Investment Research

Investors will closely be monitoring AMD’s Data Center results, especially as Wall Street continues to obsess over artificial intelligence (AI). For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Data Center revenue stands at $1.3 billion, implying a pullback of roughly 9% from the year-ago quarter.

Putting Everything Together

Investors will closely be monitoring AMD’s quarterly results, as the stock has become a household name in the semiconductor space.

Several other semiconductor names, including Intel INTC and NXP Semiconductors NXPI, have already unveiled their respective quarterly results, with both companies posting better-than-expected results and seeing buying pressure post-earnings.

For Advanced Micro Devices’ AMD quarter to be reported, analysts have primarily left their top and bottom line expectations unchanged, with both earnings and revenue forecasted to pull back from the year-ago quarter.

2023-07-31T19:52:35+00:00,7 Stocks to Buy Before They Surpass 2021 Highs,"The stock market has rebounded in 2023 following a year marked by rate hikes that pulled everything much lower. Leading indexes fell dramatically with the S&P 500 shedding 18.25% of its value. Hikes pounded the tech-heavy Nasdaq which fell by more than 30% during the same period. The emergence of AI, along with slowing rate hikes, has catalyzed a rebound in the markets in 2023. However, major indexes haven’t reached their 2021 highs. With inflation falling and rate hikes nearly over there’s reason to believe that the markets- and stocks could surge past their high marks in 2021. Let’s dive into a few of the top stocks to watch before new peaks.

Stocks to Watch Before New Peaks: AMD (AMD) man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% Upside

Source: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.com

I’ve been saying the same thing about AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) stock for the past few weeks. If you’ve read my articles during that period, this will be a bit repetitive. That said, it remains true and serves as a logical basis for prices to move upward: AMD is not that far behind its main rival, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).

The reason to believe that this is true lies in research recently released by MosaicML, a machine learning firm that was recently acquired by Databricks. MosaicML undertook extensive testing of the second-most powerful chips from AMD and Nvidia in relation to their AI prowess.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The result was particularly inspiring for AMD champions: Its chips are nearly as fast as those from Nvidia. Further, AMD’s relative strengths in software development are particularly relevant to AI. The software has been identified as an area from which rapid AI improvements will emerge. It all points to the idea that AMD could run much higher. AMD hit $154 in 2021 and currently stands at $111.

Stocks to Watch Before New Peaks: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""

Source: PX Media / Shutterstock

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock traded roughly $5 higher at its 2021 peak from its current price. You may be tempted to believe that those higher prices are logical given that it was one of the major firms to produce a Covid-19 vaccine. The logic is that revenues spiked on its approval and that Johnson & Johnson lacks a similar catalyst at the moment.

Story continues

While it’s true that there is no similar catalyst for the firm at the moment, there’s a simple reason to believe in JNJ shares. Johnson & Johnson’s revenues reached $94.94 billion in 2021. In 2023, they’re expected to eclipse $100 billion. Is that astronomical growth by any stretch of the imagination? No, not all. However, it does prove that JNJ is bigger than it was even when it had a Covid-19 vaccine. The other vaccine winners, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) will have far smaller revenue bases in 2023 than each did in 2021, respectively.

JNJ is the most stable of the bunch. Its revenues will be greater in 2023 than in 2021. Thus, its price-to-sales ratio is more attractive at the moment. Add in JNJ’s dividend and the choice gets even easier.

Stocks to Watch Before New Peaks: Coca-Cola (KO) Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker cryptos

Source: Epic Cure / Shutterstock

Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) shares traded for $60 at their peak in 2021. KO stock currently trades for $62.50 so it has actually surpassed its 2021 highs. Nevertheless, it remains worth considering at this point.

The firm released second-quarter earnings on July 26 which were very strong. Those earnings showed that sales remain very strong, growing at 6% with organic revenue growing at 11%.

That allowed management to raise its full-year forecast for organic revenue growth to between 8-9% from a previous 7-8% in 2023. The results come as Coca-Cola has raised prices even as consumers are already dealing with inflation that erodes their purchasing power. It indicates that demand remains very strong overall.

It’s difficult to find much fault in Coca-Cola’s execution and results even if you feel they could have given consumers a break in pricing. Shareholders are certainly happy. EPS increased by 34%, reaching $0.59. KO stock’s dividend is a bonus and yields nearly 3% currently.

Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) currently makes a lot of sense as a stock investment. The search giant just released second-quarter earnings that were much better than expected and should galvanize a period in which share prices rise.

Revenues for the quarter reached $74.6 billion, ahead of the $72.9 billion Wall Street had been expecting. That earnings beat will be consequential for investors over the coming weeks and months. The beat led to strong income growth of 14.79%(1) which was another bright spot for the firm.

Revenue growth reached 7% on a year-over-year basis down from 13% a year earlier. Slowing growth rates should matter but I’d argue they’re less of a concern due to the overall trajectory. Alphabet is expecting more than $300 billion in sales this year which is a turnaround from the $283 billion in 2022. Search, advertising, Cloud, and other bets are all growing and as rate hikes stop GOOG stock is in a strong position overall relative to its 2021 peak prices.

Here’s what I particularly like about META shares currently: Even though the firm’s revenues grew in both the last 3 months and the last 6 months, net income did not. It decreased on a year-over-year basis during the most recent 6 months. However, it increased on a year-over-year basis during the latest 3-month period on a year-over-year basis. That suggests that Meta Platforms is doing much better now and that a real turnaround is in effect.

That’s true despite the fact that Reality Labs’ losses are getting bigger. Ad revenues and its Facebook and Instagram apps have rebounded. That’s very important to the overall narrative for Meta. The economy looks to have dodged the worst outcomes of rate hikes at this point. That should inspire businesses to spend more on ad revenue and continue to bolster META shares in the process.

Albemarle (ALB)  tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocks

Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) has emerged as one of the more important EV stocks over the past few years. Its position is secured in the sector. Lithium demand is expected to grow. Those factors are powerful and have led Albemarle to make bold projections that should have investor interest piqued.

Before I get into that, let me quickly note how rapidly Albemarle is growing. In Q1, revenues grew by 129% reaching $2.6 billion while net income rose by 389%. Even though prices were not stable those results proved that lithium demand is massive on EV sales that aren’t weakening.

Let’s get back to those projections. Albemarle increased its 2030 lithium demand forecast by 15% over its previous expectations early this year. The company anticipates increasing demand through 2030 paired with a supply shortfall. The economic takeaway is clear: Prices are going to rise over the long term. Current prices make for a good entry point.

Microsoft (MSFT)  Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares recently tested new all-time highs of $350 before quickly falling to $330. I think the market has got it wrong: MSFT stock is worth $350 per share. The decline is an opportunity.

The reason to believe so is simple: Microsoft traded at $330 in 2021, a year in which the company reported $168 in sales. It could eclipse $240 billion in sales this year. Thus, its price-to-sales ratio clearly favors the notion that share prices could burst above $350 moving forward.

Why shouldn’t investors believe that idea? After all, Microsoft has made massive strides in AI. It is finding new revenue streams therein. Office 365 AI integrations are the latest news on that front. Time will tell how that goes. In any case, Microsoft is now a better firm than it was back in 2021 when it traded at a similar price. It’s a very simple, logical argument, and simple, logical arguments are often very powerful.

2023-07-31T11:00:27+00:00,The Returns At T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Aren't Growing,"If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. However, after investigating T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.

What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?

Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for T-Mobile US, this is the formula:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.081 = US$15b ÷ (US$211b - US$25b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).

Thus, T-Mobile US has an ROCE of 8.1%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Wireless Telecom industry average of 11%.

Check out our latest analysis for T-Mobile US  roce

In the above chart we have measured T-Mobile US' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.

How Are Returns Trending?

In terms of T-Mobile US' historical ROCE trend, it doesn't exactly demand attention. The company has consistently earned 8.1% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 208% in that time. Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital.

The Bottom Line

In conclusion, T-Mobile US has been investing more capital into the business, but returns on that capital haven't increased. Investors must think there's better things to come because the stock has knocked it out of the park, delivering a 113% gain to shareholders who have held over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.

Like most companies, T-Mobile US does come with some risks, and we've found 3 warning signs that you should be aware of.

While T-Mobile US isn't earning the highest return, check out this freelist of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.

2023-07-28T12:13:45+00:00,3 Semiconductor Stocks You Better Be Buying on Each and Every Dip,"Semiconductors are increasingly crucial as our economies become more digitized and everything gets connected. These trends bode well for top semiconductor stocks as the number of chips on devices and machines increases.

The iPhone moment of AI has arrived, meaning more chips to train AI models. Every company is considering AI regarding productivity and how it will disrupt their industries. As a result, demand for high-end chips with lots of processing power is growing.

But semiconductor usage is also growing in traditional industries. For instance, the semiconductor content in vehicles is rising. EVs require numerous chips for power electronics, battery management systems, motor control, and charging infrastructure. Moreover, modern infotainment, communication, and user interface features on modern vehicles need more semiconductors.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

With increased applications, semiconductor demand will continue to grow. However, the semiconductor industry is very competitive, with multiple competitors in each segment. Therefore, it’s crucial to pick the winners.

Leading semiconductor stocks with high returns will outperform peers. The following companies dominate their categories and will capture most of the value.

One of the top semiconductor stocks to participate in the AI theme is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Its chips have the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO) and are currently the best in training AI models. These advantages are flowing directly to the company’s financials.

On May 24, the stock reported outstanding first-quarter fiscal 2024 results. Total revenues declined 13% year-over-year, but on a sequential basis, they grew 19% from Q4 FY2023.

The biggest surprise for the markets was their guidance for the second quarter. Management issued second-quarter revenue guidance of $11.00 billion, which was $4 billion above consensus.

Story continues

Management highlighted that we are in the early innings of accelerated computing and generative AI. “A trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure will transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia.

Demand for Nvidia’s products is surging as companies enter the AI race. The firm has had to increase supply to meet the increasing demand. This demand bodes well for Nvidia’s revenue going forward.

So far, its H100 chip is the best in training AI models in the market. Notably, it enjoys a monopoly with very little competition. Although Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) recently launched a potential competitor, Nvidia has a greater than two-year head start. The MI300X is unlikely to challenge the H100’s dominance any time soon.

Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) produces analog chips for various applications. While its chips might not garner the buzz like AI chips, they are crucial in everyday applications. Its chips include data converters, embedded processors, amplifiers, radio frequency (“RF”) technologies and power management products.

The company focuses on high-quality analog chips that enable it to earn higher margins. Since these chips aren’t subject to Moore’s law, they have long product cycles and limited obsolescence risk.

Due to its prudent capital stewardship, Texas Instruments is a top semiconductor stock. Management aligns with shareholders focusing on maximizing free cash flow power share. Since 2004 it has grown the metric at an 11% annual rate.

Currently, the analog chip market is in a downturn, but no company is suited to handle the downturn better than Texas Instruments. While smaller players might struggle, it has a robust balance sheet to navigate the cycle. Furthermore, since its chips have long cycles, the company can build up inventory levels and then fulfill customer orders when the eventual recovery happens.

Taking a longer-term view, the demand for analog chips is growing. McKinsey expects the total automotive sensor market to reach $468 billion by 2030, representing a 5.6% CAGR. Texas Instruments generates 25% of revenues from automotive and is investing to meet this demand. It’s building new fabs to produce analog and embedded processing chips.

For now, TXN stock is one of the top semiconductor stocks to play the digitization and electrification trend. The stock trades at a forward P/E of 24. Additionally, the company pays an attractive 2.6% dividend. With an impressive dividend growth record for 17 consecutive years, expect them to continue flowing.

After the recent earnings-related sell-off, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the top semiconductor stocks to buy on dips. This semiconductor equipment supplier manufactures deep ultraviolet (DUV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines used in chip production.

Today, ASML has a monopoly on EUV lithography machines. This advanced equipment is crucial in making chips, and one machine can cost as much as $200 million. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Samsung, and Intel (NYSE: INTC) are its largest three customers.

Due to its monopoly, ASML enjoys tremendous profitability and is among semiconductor stocks with high returns. Over the past few years, gross margins have improved from 46% in FY2018 to over 50% in the last two years. At the same time, free cash flow per share has grown from $6.64 to $19.30 in FY2022.

Recently, ASML stock sold off after its earnings and disappointing TSMC results. The decline in TSMC’s revenues highlighted the likelihood of a prolonged downturn in the semiconductor equipment market. However, looking closely at ASML’s second quarter 2023 results paint a different picture.

For the quarter, revenues grew sequentially from €6.7 billion to €6.9 billion. In terms of YOY performance, revenue growth was 27.8%. Management also issued an optimistic outlook. “ASML expects strong growth for 2023 with a net sales increase towards 30% and a slight improvement in gross margin, relative to 2022,” said ASML President and CEO Peter Wennink.

Given the company’s dominant position, revenues will increase as accelerated computing and artificial intelligence grow. Buy ASML stock now for growth and returns.

2023-07-31T21:57:00+00:00,Advanced Micro Devices Q2 Preview: Time to Buy?,"It’s the busiest week of earnings season, with an extensive list of companies scheduled to unveil their quarterly results.

There are several notable names on the reporting docket, including the highly-followed Advanced Micro Devices AMD. AMD shares have been big-time outperformers in 2023 so far, up more than 70% following a brutal 2022 showing.

But how does the semiconductor titan stack up heading into its quarterly release? Let’s take a closer look at expectations and results from a few other chip players, including NXP Semiconductors NXPI and Intel INTC, as a light guide.

Intel

Intel posted better-than-expected Q2 results, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 420%. Quarterly revenue totaled $12.9 billion, 8% ahead of expectations and down from the year-ago quarter.

The market took the results in stride, with Intel shares finding plenty of buyers post-earnings. Impressively, both top and bottom line results exceeded the higher end of previous guidance. Zacks Investment Research

NXP Semiconductors

NXP Semiconductors also posted better-than-expected top and bottom line results, exceeding EPS expectations by 5% and delivering a 3% revenue beat. Similar to INTC, the company’s revenue results were at the high end of previous guidance, undoubtedly a positive.

And the market took the results well, with NXPI shares seeing bullish activity post-earnings. Zacks Investment Research

Advanced Micro Devices

Analysts have been silent for the quarter to be reported over the last several months, with the $0.57 per share estimate unchanged. The value reflects a 45% pullback in earnings from the year-ago quarter. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

The story remains primarily the same regarding the top line, with the $5.3 billion quarterly estimate down a fractional 0.1% since the beginning of May. Sales are forecasted to decline along with earnings, with the estimate suggesting an 18% pullback year-over-year.

Story continues Zacks Investment Research

In addition, AMD has been a consistent earnings performer as of late, exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations in nine of its last ten releases. Just in its latest print, AMD delivered a 7% EPS beat paired with a modest revenue surprise.

It’s worth noting that the market has been impressed with the last two releases, with AMD shares seeing notable bullish momentum post-earnings. This is illustrated by the green arrows circled in the chart below. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Investors will closely be monitoring AMD’s Data Center results, especially as Wall Street continues to obsess over artificial intelligence (AI). For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Data Center revenue stands at $1.3 billion, implying a pullback of roughly 9% from the year-ago quarter.

Putting Everything Together

Investors will closely be monitoring AMD’s quarterly results, as the stock has become a household name in the semiconductor space.

Several other semiconductor names, including Intel INTC and NXP Semiconductors NXPI, have already unveiled their respective quarterly results, with both companies posting better-than-expected results and seeing buying pressure post-earnings.

For Advanced Micro Devices’ AMD quarter to be reported, analysts have primarily left their top and bottom line expectations unchanged, with both earnings and revenue forecasted to pull back from the year-ago quarter.

2023-07-31T15:09:00+00:00,Amgen (AMGN) to Report Q2 Earnings: Here's What to Expect,"Amgen AMGN will report second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 3, after market close. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 3.65%.

Factors to Consider

Amgen’s product sales are expected to have risen as prescription trends and demand for most of its medicines are expected to have improved to pre-pandemic levels despite the current macroeconomic challenges.

In the second quarter, volume growth from Amgen’s key drugs like Evenity, Repatha and Prolia is expected to have driven top-line growth.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Prolia, Repatha, and Evenity sales are pegged at $974 million, $382 million and $262.0 million, respectively.

Our estimates for Prolia, Repatha and Evenity sales are pegged at $962.6 million, $366.2 million, and $242.5 million, respectively.

In addition, newer drugs like Tezspire and Tavneos are expected to have contributed to top-line growth.

Like the first quarter of 2023, sales of Otezla in the United States are expected to have been hurt by free drug programs launched by new competitors. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Otezla is $587.0 million, while our estimate is $590.3 million.

Also, increasing branded and generic competition for its legacy products like Enbrel, Aranesp, Epogen, Neupogen, Neulasta and Sensipar are likely to have hurt the top line.

Regarding Enbrel, Amgen expects low single-digit volume growth. The decline in prices is expected to have reduced in the second quarter, while inventory levels are expected to have recovered from first-quarter levels. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Enbrel is $868.0 million, while our estimate is $797.3 million.

Also, pricing pressure and increased competition are likely to have continued to hurt sales of some drugs as well as biosimilar products like Kanjinti and Mvasi. Sales of relatively newer medicine, Lumakras, may have declined sequentially, due to lower net selling price. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lumakras/Lumykras is $88.0 million, while our estimate is $89.0 million.

Second-quarter sales of Amjevita, Amgen’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s ABBV drug Humira, are expected to have been lower than first-quarter sales of $164 million. This is because most of U.S. Amjevita sales in the first quarter stemmed from inventory build. Amgen launched Amjevita in the United States at a 55% lower list price than the current price set by AbbVie for Humira in February. Amgen already markets a biosimilar of AbbVie’s Humira, Amgevita, in the United States.

Update on Horizon Therapeutics’ Acquisition

In May, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) filed a lawsuit in Federal Court to halt Amgen's proposed $28 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics HZNP.

Per the FTC, if the acquisition is allowed to go through, a large-cap giant like Amgen could leverage its position with insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers to entrench the monopoly positions for two of Horizon's key products — Tepezza (approved for treating thyroid eye disease) and Krystexxa (approved for treating chronic refractory gout). Per the agency, the drugs currently face little to no competition in the market and are sold at very high prices to patients.

2023-07-28T12:00:46+00:00,Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) Seems To Use Debt Quite Sensibly,"Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) does use debt in its business. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.

When Is Debt Dangerous?

Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.

Check out our latest analysis for Amgen

What Is Amgen's Net Debt?

As you can see below, at the end of March 2023, Amgen had US$61.6b of debt, up from US$36.9b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. On the flip side, it has US$31.6b in cash leading to net debt of about US$30.0b. debt-equity-history-analysis

A Look At Amgen's Liabilities

The latest balance sheet data shows that Amgen had liabilities of US$14.2b due within a year, and liabilities of US$69.2b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$31.6b and US$5.74b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$46.1b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.

This deficit isn't so bad because Amgen is worth a massive US$125.7b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.

Story continues

We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.

Amgen has net debt worth 2.3 times EBITDA, which isn't too much, but its interest cover looks a bit on the low side, with EBIT at only 5.8 times the interest expense. While that doesn't worry us too much, it does suggest the interest payments are somewhat of a burden. Importantly Amgen's EBIT was essentially flat over the last twelve months. Ideally it can diminish its debt load by kick-starting earnings growth. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Amgen's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this freereport showing analyst profit forecasts.

But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the last three years, Amgen recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 91% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.

Our View

On our analysis Amgen's conversion of EBIT to free cash flow should signal that it won't have too much trouble with its debt. But the other factors we noted above weren't so encouraging. For instance it seems like it has to struggle a bit handle its debt, based on its EBITDA,. When we consider all the elements mentioned above, it seems to us that Amgen is managing its debt quite well. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Amgen is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about...

2023-07-31T16:52:52+00:00,Rocket Companies Stock Gains After New CEO Announcement - The Details,"Rocket Companies, Inc (NYSE: RKT) shares traded higher Monday after selecting Varun Krishna as the CEO, effective September 5, 2023.

Krishna will succeed Bill Emerson, who has served as interim CEO since June.

Emerson will continue in his interim role until Krishna joins the company and will remain on the Rocket Companies Board while working with Krishna to ensure a smooth leadership transition.

Krishna has over 20 years of experience building consumer platform strategies for leading global fintech companies. Most recently, Krishna served as Executive Vice President and General Manager, Consumer Group of Intuit Inc (NASDAQ: INTU).

Bob Walters informed the board of his intention to retire on September 5, when he will step down from his roles as CEO of Rocket Mortgage and President and COO of Rocket Companies.

Krishna will succeed Walters at that time as Rocket Mortgage CEO, and Emerson will assume the roles of President and COO for Rocket Companies.

In February 2023, former Rocket Companies CEO Jay Farner announced his decision to step down from his position in June after more than 27 years with the company.

Farner was appointed the CEO of Rocket Mortgage in 2017 and later became CEO of Rocket Companies as part of its IPO.

Rocket Companies provides customers with mortgage, real estate and financial services. According to Bankrate.com, Rocket Mortgage is the largest mortgage lender in the United States by a significant margin.

Rocket Companies stock has gained 57% year-to-date. The 30-year FRM stands at 6.35%, while the 15-year FRM is at 5.75%, hinting at a moderating inflation rate.

A stable rate environment could drive more borrowers towards refinancing or purchasing new homes. However, the rapid buying rate indicates that the housing market demand remains strong despite elevated mortgage rates.

Price Action: RKT shares traded higher by 3.14% at $11.17 on the last check Monday.

2023-07-31T16:22:00+00:00,"Top Analyst Reports for Tesla, Comcast &amp; Intuit","Monday, July 31, 2023

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), Comcast Corporation (CMCSA) and Intuit Inc. (INTU). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>

Tesla shares have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the past six months (+46.6% vs. +32.1%). In the last reported quarter, the electric vehicle (EV) giant witnessed record production, deliveries and revenues. We expect deliveries to see an annualized growth of around 36% in 2023.

Production ramp-up at gigafactory 4 (in Berlin) and 5 (in Austin) and introduction of new models, including Semi and Cybertruck, are set to support long-term deliveries growth. The Zacks analyst anticipates automotive revenues to rise more than 18% this year. Additionally, Tesla’s energy generation and storage revenues outlook is promising.

Falling debt levels and solid potential of its charging business are other positives. While shrinking margins remain a near-term concern, we expect Tesla to deliver outsized returns in the long run on the back of output ramp-up and introduction of new models.

(You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>>)

Shares of Comcast have outperformed the Zacks Cable Television industry over the past year (+24.9% vs. +4.5%). The company is benefiting from a growing wireless subscriber base as witnessed in the second quarter of 2023. Comcast’s plan to transition to DOCSIS 4.0 is noteworthy. The technology will help it in expanding much faster and at a lower cost compared to competitors.

Recovery in park and movie business bodes well for Comcast’s profitability. Its streaming service Peacock is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy.

However, Comcast persistently suffers from video-subscriber attrition due to cord cutting. Moreover, broadband prospects are suffering from increased competition from fixed wireless as well as fiber. Additionally, a leveraged balance sheet is a major concern.

(You can read the full research report on Comcast here >>>)

Shares of Intuit have gained +15.4% over the past year against the Zacks Computer - Software industry’s gain of +24.7%. The company is benefiting from strong momentum in online ecosystem revenues and solid professional tax revenues. The TurboTax Live offering is also driving growth in the Consumer tax business.

Solid momentum in the company’s lending product, QuickBooks Capital, remains a positive. Moreover, the company’s strategy of shifting its business to cloud-based subscription model will help generate stable revenues over the long run.

Nonetheless, macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds might significantly hurt small businesses operations, thereby posing risks for Intuit’s top-line growth. Additionally, higher costs and expenses due to increased investments in marketing and engineering teams are likely to continue impacting bottom-line results in the near term.

2023-07-31T12:47:00+00:00,Will Top-Line Contraction Hurt Qualcomm's (QCOM) Q3 Earnings?,"Qualcomm Incorporated QCOM is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Aug 2, after the closing bell. It pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.05%, on average. The company is expected to have recorded lower year-over-year revenues due to falling demand for its smartphone chips amid global uncertainty.

Factors at Play

During the to-be-reported quarter, Qualcomm introduced Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 mobile platform to boost performance and ensure greater power efficiency. It provides effortless, all-day use with fast CPU speeds, sharp photography and videography, and optimal 5G connectivity. It also launched two modem chipsets with satellite capability — the Qualcomm 212S Modem and the Qualcomm 9205S Modem — providing connectivity and coverage even in the most remote areas.

During the quarter, Qualcomm extended its collaboration with Sony and agreed to work together on the next generations of premium, high- and mid-tier smartphones. The partnership aims to integrate Qualcomm’s advanced Snapdragon mobile platforms into Sony’s future smartphone lines, providing users with enhanced functionality, higher performance and immersive user experiences. This is likely to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.

However, Qualcomm anticipates a rapid deterioration in demand for its handset chips, as high inventory combined with low demand situations have forced vendors to reduce shipments drastically. Rising geopolitical tension in Europe and Asia is fueling global instability and adding to the macroeconomic challenges. In addition, softness in demand in China due to the adverse economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic is likely to have affected unit volumes. These are likely to have hurt the company’s fiscal third-quarter revenues.

For the June quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $8,514 million, indicating a decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $10,936 million. Adjusted earnings per share are pegged at $1.81, suggesting a contraction from $2.96 in the year-earlier quarter.

Our revenue estimate for the QCT segment is pegged at $7,263.2 million, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 22.6%, while that for the QTL segment is pegged at $1,210.6 million, down 20.3%.

Story continues

Key Developments in Q3

In the fiscal third quarter, Qualcomm inked an agreement to acquire Autotalks for an undisclosed amount. Autotalks is a fabless semiconductor company focused on V2X (vehicle-to-everything) communications. It provides automotive-qualified dual-mode global V2X solutions compatible with multiple V2X standards that are designed to reduce collisions and improve mobility. The combination of Autotalks’ expertise and industry-leading products with Qualcomm’s deep know-how is likely to help accelerate the development and adoption of V2X solutions to improve traffic efficiency and road user safety.

Earnings Whispers

Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Qualcomm for the fiscal third quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is perfectly the case here.

Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +3.68%, with the former pegged at $1.88 and the latter at $1.81. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

2023-07-31T10:22:31+00:00,Qualcomm results may have 'upside relative to investor expectations' - JPMorgan,"Investing.com -- Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) upcoming earnings this week could surprise relatively low investor expectations, according to JPMorgan analysts, citing recent returns from the U.S. chip designer's rivals.

The market for smartphones has faced headwinds as inflation-hit consumers rein in spending on non-essential items, replacement cycles elongate, and handset makers struggle to come up with new advances to entice customers. In the first quarter, global smartphone shipments slipped by 13%, according to research firm Canalys.

As a result, semiconductor companies have built up a glut of excess chips on their shelves. Some investors are worried that these firms, including Qualcomm, will drive down chip prices to clear out backlogs, subsequently placing pressure on gross margins.

But in a note to clients on Monday, the JPMorgan analysts defended their ""favorable view"" of Qualcomm heading into the results on Wednesday. Almost two weeks ago, the analysts gave an upbeat prediction for San Diego-based Qualcomm's fiscal third-quarter returns, citing ""very early signs"" of recovery in the global smartphone market.

The analysts argued that the latest returns for Qualcomm's Taiwanese peer MediaTek Inc (TW:2454) bolster their case. Revenues at MediaTek expanded on a quarterly basis in the second quarter, they noted, and are expected to continue growing in the current three-month period thanks in part to ""improved trends in smartphones.""

Smartphone supplier Amphenol (NYSE:APH) also posted quarterly revenue that beat estimates, the analysts said. They added that the electronic connector maker expects its mobile handset revenue ""to increase at a more robust pace and at an above seasonal level.""

Given these trends, the analysts said they continued to see ""upside relative to investor expectations for Qualcomm,"" and reiterated their overweight rating of the stock.

Amazon and Apple are set to round out a multi-week crush of earnings from Big Tech, while nonfarm payroll figures for July could provide clues into the impact of over a year of Federal Reserve policy tightening.

1. Futures edge higher

U.S. stock futures inched up on Monday, but stayed close to the flatline, as investors looked ahead to a fresh batch of tech earnings and key U.S. employment data this week.

At 05:12 ET (09:12 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 18 points or 0.05%, S&P futures added 4 points or 0.08%, and Nasdaq 100 futures moved up by 8 points or 0.05%.

The main indices remain on track to post monthly gains before the final trading day of July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which saw its longest win streak since 1987 snapped last week, is up 3.1% this month, while the S&P 500 has climbed 3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has added 3.8%.

As July turns to August, traders are awaiting earnings later in the week from Amazon and Apple, as well as chipmakers AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).

Meanwhile, the crucial U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for July is due out on Friday, with economists predicting that the world's biggest economy added fewer jobs compared to the prior month.

2. Amazon and Apple results ahead

E-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will both report their latest quarterly results on Thursday, rounding out a wave of closely-watched Big Tech earnings in recent weeks.

Focus will likely hover around how the companies' revenue flows fared during a three-month period marked by economic uncertainty that has persuaded some businesses and individuals to rein in spending.

For Amazon, attention will likely turn to its all-important cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, where growth decelerated in the previous quarter. Amazon has also flagged that the slowdown at the division continued into April.

Apple, meanwhile, will deliver its first results since the unveiling of its highly-anticipated Vision Pro headset in June. Despite the excitement around the device, weaker consumer demand is expected to weigh on other products like the iPhone and iPad.

Analysts may also be keen to question Amazon and Apple executives about their plans for artificial intelligence (AI). Last week, tech peers Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) cautioned that spending levels may soon rise as they race to develop AI tools.

3. U.S. jobs report highlights economic calendar

Hiring in the U.S. is projected to have slowed in July, but the job market is expected to remain relatively tight even in the face of aggressive Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.

Economists predict that total nonfarm employment rose by 200,000 during the month, down from the June reading of 209,000, while the jobless rate is expected to remain steady at 3.6%.

The labor market has been a major focus of the Fed's long-standing monetary tightening campaign, with policymakers arguing that a loosening in employer demand could help alleviate inflationary pressures. The Fed increased interest rates by 25 basis points last week, but suggested that any future decisions would be ""data-dependent.""

Despite signs of moderation, job growth has remained robust in recent months. The strength has in turn fueled speculation that the Fed may be able to engineer a so-called ""soft landing"" -- corralling inflation without sparking a meltdown in the broader economy.

Friday's figures may provide more clarity on this key question.

4. SEC asked Coinbase to halt all non-Bitcoin trading - FT

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requested that Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) cease trading in all digital tokens except for Bitcoin prior to filing a lawsuit against the cryptocurrency exchange, according to the Financial Times.

In an interview, Coinbase Chief Executive Brian Armstrong told the paper that the SEC ""said...we believe every asset other than bitcoin is a security."" Armstrong added that the regulators then asked that Coinbase delist all of the more than 200 tokens it offers to customers, apart from Bitcoin.

Armstrong refuted the claim, saying that agreeing to the shutdowns ""would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the U.S."" Instead, he said Coinbase decided to challenge the SEC's assertions in court.

The SEC has been angling to gain more control over the crypto industry, with Chair Gary Gensler arguing that most cryptocurrencies qualify as securities, or tradeable financial assets. Coinbase was sued by the SEC last month for failing to register as a broker.

Should the SEC win this case, it could set a precedent for the power regulators in the U.S. have over crypto businesses and potentially lead to more stringent compliance rules.

For its part, the SEC told the FT that its enforcement division did not make formal requests for ""companies to delist crypto assets."" It also declined to comment on what the delisting would mean for the crypto industry.

5. Walmart boosts Flipkart stake - WSJ

Retail giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT) has further cemented its interest in Flipkart through a $1.4 billion purchase of shares from a major investor in the Indian e-commerce group, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Walmart bought New York-based hedge fund Tiger Global's remaining shares in Flipkart, the paper reported, citing a letter sent by Tiger to its investors. The transaction valued Flipkart at $35B, down from the almost $38B attached by Tiger to the company in 2021.

Meanwhile, Walmart also bought out private equity firm Accel's remaining 1% stake in Flipkart, the Economic Times newspaper reported, although the size of the purchase was unknown.

The moves boost Walmart's exposure to Flipkart at a time when the Arkansas-based company is looking to expand its presence in the digital commerce space. Walmart paid $16B more than five years ago for an initial 77% stake in Flipkart, a wide-ranging business catering to more than 450 million customers.

2023-07-31T00:00:00+00:00,How Smart Money Is Playing The $700 Billion EV Boom,"China is the “800-pound gorilla” of global EV supplies, and it dominates this market in every way, including sales. Last year, China’s exports of EVs increased 131.8% YoY to some 680,000 units, based on official data. In the first half of 2023, the Chinese sold 2,093,000 EVs.

Last year’s and this year’s global EV markets are breaking all kinds of records, but China is the clear frontrunner—by miles—accounting for around 60% of global electric car sales, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). More than half of the EVs on the roads today, are in China, and it’s already exceeded its 2025 target for new energy vehicles.

In Europe, the second largest market, EV sales rose by over 15% in 2022, while sales in the United States – the third largest market – increased 55% in 2022, reaching a global share of 8%.

Electric vehicle sales are set for a 35% year-on-year increase in 2023, with national policies and incentives providing further impetus for producers and consumers. So far, overall, this has been rewarding for investors, especially considering that the top 14 EV stocks with only a fraction of the market capitalization of their traditional auto giant peers ended up outperforming them on the stock market.

And the next wave is in the water.

The recreational electric boat playing field is far less chaotic and crowded, and the first-mover advantage goes to Vision Marine Technologies (NASDAQ:VMAR), which offers a proprietary PowerTrain outboard motor that is being used in the launch of the fastest electric speedboat in its class on the market.

As the electric vehicle playing field shifts to the waterways, it’s not surprising to find celebrity figures such as NFL superstar Tom Brady joining in by buying an electric boat racing team for the inaugural UIM E1 World Championship, which will launch in early 2024.

But Vision Marine is already on the waterways with, with a first-of-its-kind proprietary outboard motor and powertrain powering the newly unveiled H2e Bowrider speed boat, which made its official debut in February in Miami, with deliveries set to start this summer.

The boat, developed in partnership with Four Winns, is special because it showcases VMAR’s E-Motion 180 HP electric outboard motor.

That motor, with proprietary PowerTrain technology, makes the H2e Bowrider the first all-electric series production bowrider on the market.

This is only the beginning.

VMAR’s proprietary electric motor and powertrain system can turn any boat into an electric boat.

And its sales strategy removes any notion of the unwanted cash burn that EV manufacturers are burdening investors with right now. VMAR plans to sell motors (not boats) to OEMs in an incredibly savvy move in a market flooded with struggling, cash-negative EV makers. VMAR is expecting first revenues from PowerTrain this year.

VMAR is also developing an electric system for pontoons and a major second revenue chain that involves completely flipping the massive boat rental market from ICE to electric.

With the build-out well underway, VMAR now says it is positioned to be free-cash-flow positive in 2024.

The World’s Most Powerful Electric Powertrain

Vision Marine has already made history once.

Last fall, the company broke the world electric boat speed record at 109 MPH in a 100% electric boat in the Lake of the Ozarks Shootout, the largest boating event of the year in North America.

Now, it’s about to do it again, on a journey that (in their own words) “will challenge the limits of what was thought possible”.

Armed with cutting-edge electric propulsion technology, Vision Marine (NASDAQ:VMAR), is equipping its Zenith pontoon with electric propulsion and solar panels for the longest known electric boat run in America. This month, they will embark on a 1,050-nautical-mile journey from Norfolk, Virginia, to Miami, Florida.

Vision Marine’s E-Motion is the first fully electric, production-ready, high-performance 180 HP outboard motor on the market.

The 180E Electric Powertrain can provide a consistent 180 HP of pure electric power, with cutting-edge high voltage power when you need it most, and a completely scalable powerbank.

The proprietary technology is end-to-end: It includes the batteries, the engine and the software, making it the only turn-key solution for boat manufacturers in its class.

The E-Motion outboard motor can fully charge overnight with no additional infrastructure and boasts the highest horsepower engine in its class. And from a pricing perspective, it beats everyone else, which should help it to capture new market share.

For Vision Marine, this first-mover advantage is key, and it’s already received advance orders from OEMs.

Last September, right out of the gate, VMAR received an initial purchase order from the North America’s Limestone Boat Company for $2 million worth (25 units) of E-Motion 180E outboard motors and Powertrain systems. Limestone is now moving into scheduled production, with delivery target to dealers set to begin in 2024. 
VMAR also plans to completely transform  the massive, global boat rental market already valued at well over $18 billion and on its way to topping $30 billion by 2031.

Here, too, Vision Marine (NASDAQ:VMAR) is in a leadership position, with its flagship Newport business serving 300,000 clients in the first three years, and annualizing $4 million in revenues with a 35% profit margin. The plan for the rest of this year is to build this out with two more fully-owned electric boat rental locations and the launch of a franchise model. After that, it’s smooth sailing and all about scaling, scaling, scaling.

By the end of 2024, Nasdaq-listed Vision Marine expects to be free-cash-flow positive, and by 2025, it expects to have two profitable and growing divisions, after which the scaling is expected to gain further momentum.

The Start of a $12-Billion Transition in the Water

From NFL superstar Tom Brady and the first-ever electric boat racing world cup to two history-making VMAR records, the waterways are undergoing a sea change. This is the biggest transition in boating history since the first gasoline-powered outboard motors came on the market in 1896.

The global electric boat market was valued at $5 billion in 2021, and is projected to reach $16.6 billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 12.9% from 2022 to 2031. More specifically, the 40-foot electric boat market alone is worth $1.9 billion as of 2023, and is poised to reach $4.93 billion by 2030 for a growth rate of 14.6% over the next 8 years. The marine battery market, too, is explosive, and represents a $2-billion opportunity for investors over the next five years.

All the hype isn’t just about climate change, either—though that is the driving impetus. Water-lovers appreciate the absence of extremely noisy gasoline-powered boat motors and enjoy the peaceful quiet of electric, as well as the fact that from a safety perspective, there is no risk of gasoline leakage or carbon monoxide poisoning. Also adding to the attraction is longer-term savings, not just in gasoline, but also in maintenance costs. Electric outboard motors are said to require far less maintenance, making them cheaper overall to operate.

The world is at the beginning of a ~$12-billion transition to electric boats, and Vision Marine Technologies seems to be the frontrunner in this new, fast-moving space, breaking all kinds of records and following a sales strategy that avoids the cash-burn typical of this space.

Dow Stocks to Buy: Merck (MRK) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks

Source: shutterstock.com/CC7

From a pure potential perspective, Merck (NYSE:MRK) stock offers a lot to investors. Past returns might not be an absolute indicator of future performance. However, they tend to be a reasonable indicator given that strong firms usually tend to continue to do well. Merck is particularly attractive for that reason. Over the past 10 years, its stock has returned 13.02% annually. That’s roughly 149% better than the average stock during the same period.

Further, Merck continues to offer upside currently. Wall Street analysts believe there’s about 20% upside in MRK hares beyond their current price. Not convinced yet? Well, it also includes a dividend that hasn’t been reduced since 1985 that adds an additional 2.75% return to its shares.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Revenues have slowed slightly of late at the firm. However, Merck has grown faster than every other large-cap pharmaceutical firm in the U.S. over the past 3 years with the exception of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). Strip out Pfizer’s extraordinary Covid-19 windfall and Marck may have been the outright leader.

Dow Stocks to Buy: Apple (AAPL) A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.

Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.com

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has contributed heavily to the 2023 turnaround in markets. Better, investors expect Apple shares to hold value due to the ubiquity of its products and an expectation it will continue to thrive.

That notion is primarily related to the continued strength of iPhone sales. Apple sold $51.33 billion worth of iPhones during the most recent quarter. That was a record for the company and is part of the reason Apple shares continue to surge even as overall revenues continue to sag. The explanation is simple: Investors understand that Apple has figured out how to create and market products that have such mass appeal that quarterly fluctuations are hardly a concern.

Story continues

The company can find revenues elsewhere in the short term as it is doing with services. However, the real reason to buy in now is that Apple is on the cusp of its first new product release in a decade with Apple Vision Pro and new markets for legacy products, particularly India.

Dow Stocks to Buy: JPMorgan (JPM) tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocks

Source: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.com

JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock continues to look better and better in the aftermath of the banking crisis. It is now old news that JPMorgan took over First Republic, acting as an anchor to the U.S. banking system.

However, that notion is worth examining again because it means JPMorgan has extended its dominant position in the U.S. banking sector. And when big firms get bigger that’s generally a reasonable time to consider investing. JPMorgan is certainly bigger now than it was a year ago so it is the tie to invest. Revenues increased by 34%, reaching $41.3 billion. The bank was able to derive $14.47 billion in net income from that which represented a 67% increase year-over-year.

The company gained First Republic’s wealth banking business from the takeover. That will allow the company to cater better to wealthy coastal clientele. Meanwhile, JPMorgan is currently also benefiting from surging interest income as it lends more through credit cards to cash-strapped Americans unwilling or unable to cut back on spending.

Honeywell (HON) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks

Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com

Honeywell (NYSE:HON) is perhaps not the most exciting stock on this list but it does offer investors a reasonable amount of upside potential over the next few years. The firm serves a wide swath of the economy and firms through industrial software.

There’s a lot of potential in that area for the company especially given that Honeywell is deeply connected to the building technologies sector. The opportunity to drive revenues from the emerging IoT opportunity gives Honeywell strong future prospects and growth paths.

However, Honeywell hasn’t been growing much lately. Its 3-year 1.1% revenue growth rate of 1.1% is worse than average for its sector. Honeywell is expected to grow faster than that this year and next. That should correlate to increasing share prices as markets will appreciate the growth and Honeywell’s IoT potential. Investors can also expect rising earnings as top-line results improve in 2023 and through 2024. It is a solid stock worth owning over that period.

Nike (NKE) A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneath

Source: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.com

The bull case for investing in Nike (NYSE:NKE) stock is fairly straightforward right now. For those who believe that the brand’s power matters, there’s a lot of upside in initiating a position at this moment.

Nike is the largest sports brand by market capitalization. It is far ahead of the next closest competitor and even farther ahead of Adidas, the nearest shoe seller. That ranking does not look to be changing any time soon and that suggests that as Nike works through its current problems it will emerge more valuable on the other side due to its position.

Nike products continue to sell well with sales increasing by 8% during the most recent quarter. However, the firm has been impacted by a combination of higher costs and markdowns that sent net income falling by 28% during the same timeframe.

It should be as simple as that for investors: If you believe Nike is capable of working through the kinks and ironing out its operations it’s a great time to buy given that sales continue to grow.

The outlook for an already strong Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is getting stronger. Microsoft has done extraordinarily well in 2023 due primarily to AI. The company invested heavily in to ChatGPT and emerged as the clear leader when generative AI exploded earlier this year.

At that time, Microsoft’s outlook improved because the integration of AI into its products expanded its overall market. That wasn’t the end, though. More recently, Microsoft announced aggressive pricing for some of its AI products. The announcement leads to the possibility of even higher revenues than previously expected making MSFT shares even more attractive.

It’s difficult to ignore Microsft, frankly. It has Microsft 365 office products, Azure cloud, a large stake in OpenAI, and a track record of winning for such a long time that it almost gets ignored when it continues to win. On top of that, Microsoft gets to merge with Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) improving its gaming industry standing and carving a deeper path for dominance in that burgeoning sector.

Cisco (CSCO) image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocks

I believe Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock should appeal to a certain type of tech investor currently. The company focuses on networking and things like internet protocol products and services. It is a leader in its sector but isn’t considered among the tech giants by any means. That’s where I want to start regarding Cisco as an opportunity.

At some point, tech investors will diversify away from the magnificent 7 and into less volatile tech. With a beta of 0.99, Cisco is among the least volatile tech stocks available. It’s a safer bet on tech growth and one that investors worried about ongoing concentration in the tech sector might consider.  If you want to diversify out of those mega names, Cisco is a reasonable choice.

It will likely grow by 10% this year. That’s not bad at all. It isn’t Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) style explosive growth but the flipside is that Cisco offers a dividend yielding 3.04% currently. That’s quite high within the tech sector and serves to make Cisco’s returns significantly higher overall.

This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.02%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.23%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.12%.

Heading into today, shares of the online booking service had gained 8.96% over the past month, outpacing the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 3.93% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.14% in that time.

Booking Holdings will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be August 3, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $29.10, up 52.52% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $5.11 billion, up 19.09% from the year-ago period.

For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $137.69 per share and revenue of $20.38 billion, which would represent changes of +37.92% and +19.23%, respectively, from the prior year.

Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Booking Holdings. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.

Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.

Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.59% higher. Booking Holdings currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).

Investors should also note Booking Holdings's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 21.37. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 21.33, which means Booking Holdings is trading at a premium to the group.

It is also worth noting that BKNG currently has a PEG ratio of 1.08. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Internet - Commerce industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.05 as of yesterday's close.

The Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 186, which puts it in the bottom 27% of all 250+ industries.

The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

2023-07-30T13:00:26+00:00,"Applied Materials, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMAT) high institutional ownership speaks for itself as stock continues to impress, up 11% over last week","Key Insights

Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Applied Materials' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 49% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Recent sales by insiders

A look at the shareholders of Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 83% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).

And things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$13b in market cap last week. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 45%.

Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Applied Materials.

View our latest analysis for Applied Materials  ownership-breakdown

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Applied Materials?

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

Applied Materials already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Applied Materials' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth

Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Applied Materials. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.7% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.3% and 7.3%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.

Story continues

Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

Insider Ownership Of Applied Materials

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.

Our information suggests that Applied Materials, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$445m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 17% stake in Applied Materials. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.

Next Steps:

I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that  Applied Materials is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about...

2023-07-27T23:00:00+00:00,Is This The Best Way To Play The $700 Billion EV Boom?,"Electric vehicle sales are set for a 35% year-on-year increase in 2023, with national policies and incentives providing further impetus for producers and consumers. So far, overall, this has been rewarding for investors.

While the top 14 EV stocks had a market capitalization representing only 13% of that of the Top 10 vehicle manufacturers as of the end of 2019, they still managed to outperform them. That trend continued through last year, both with EV and battery stocks.

Electric car sales exceeded 10 million units in 2022, with their market share steadily climbing, from less than 5% of new cars sold in 2020 to 14% in 2022. In the first quarter of this year, we already saw a 25% jump in sales, year-on-year.

But this space has become extremely crowded, resulting in a price war that is making investors uneasy.

It’s time to find a new niche in the EV segment where first-movers have a very clear advantage: electric boating, where innovators hope to take the EV revolution off-road.

The waterways are going electric, too.

That’s why the next big thing in racing is all-electric, with NFL superstar Tom Brady joining the UIM E1 World Championship with ownership of an electric boat racing team. The inaugural season of the EV boating world championship is set to launch in early 2024.

The electric boat playing field is far less chaotic and crowded, and the first-mover advantage goes to Vision Marine Technologies (NASDAQ:VMAR), which offers a proprietary PowerTrain outboard motor that is being used in the launch of the fastest electric speedboat in its class on the market.

The newly unveiled H2e Bowrider speed boat took the Paris Boat Show by storm in December, and made its official debut in February in Miami, with deliveries expected to start this summer.

The boat, developed in partnership with Four Winns, is special because it showcases VMAR’s E- Motion 180 HP electric outboard motor.

That motor, with proprietary PowerTrain technology, makes the H2e Bowrider the first all-electric series production bowrider on the market.

Story continues

The company is expecting first revenues from PowerTrain this year and is aggressively pursuing an electric disruption to the boat rental market, with franchise plans well underway. While it’s been all about build-out and launch over the past couple of years, VMAR is positioned to be free-cash-flow positive next year, and it’s not burning cash like its road warrior brethren.

The Sound of Silence Opportunity

The global electric boat market was valued at $5 billion in 2021, and is projected to reach $16.6 billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 12.9% from 2022 to 2031.

Narrowing that down by type, the 40-foot electric boat market alone is worth $1.9 billion as of 2023, and is set to hit $4.93 billion by 2030 for a growth rate of 14.6% during that time period.

As we speak, the multi-billion-dollar boat battery market is undergoing its biggest transition since the invention of the boat motor itself. Not only is the marine battery market forecast to grow by 18.6% to 2030, but it represents a $2-billion opportunity for investors over the next five years.

And while climate change is a key element propping up the electric boating industry, it’s not the only ‘attraction’:

Electric boats are quiet. They completely change the boating aesthetic by removing the sound of the loud outdoor motor, which overwhelms all other sound at sea. They’re safe, too.  There’s no risk of gasoline leaks or carbon monoxide poisoning common with internal combustion engines. The consensus seems to be that electric boat motors, by design, are more robust than their loud and dirty predecessors, and they also require a lot less frequent maintenance than a gasoline engine. They’re cheaper to operate over the long-run: No oil changes, no filters or tune-ups, and while combustion engines require maintenance every 100 hours, electric motors (on average) can go up to 3,000 hours

The World’s Most Powerful Electric PowerTrain

Vision Marine’s E-Motion is the first fully electric, production-ready, high-performance 180 HP outboard motor on the market.

The 180E Electric Powertrain can provide a consistent 180 HP of pure electric power, with cutting-edge high voltage power when you need it most, and a completely scalable powerbank.

The proprietary technology is end-to-end: It includes the batteries, the engine and the software, making it the only turn-key solution for boat manufacturers in its class.

The E-Motion outboard motor can fully charge overnight with no additional infrastructure and boasts the highest horsepower engine in its class. And from a cost perspective, it out-competes everyone else, which should help it to capture new market share.

Vision Marine’s (NASDAQ:VMAR),  E-Motion motor isn’t confined to speedboats, either; they’re turning pontoon boats into faster, better and cleaner versions of themselves.

VMAR is in the process of equipping a pontoon with electric propulsion and solar panels for the longest known electric boat run in America (and possibly in the world). VMAR’s Zenith pontoon will set off in Virginia on a 1,050-nautical-mile journey to Miami, Florida, to showcase the capabilities of sustainable electric power.

How they plan to market the E-Motion Powertrain is the part that should sound more attractive to investors who may or may not have been taken for a wild ride with EV investments. VMAR isn’t trying to manufacturer its own boats, which would mean burning through cash at an untenable rate (just like all the smaller EV companies right now). Instead, it’s marketing E-Motion to OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), and they’ve already received an impressive volume of orders.

Last September, right out of the gate, VMAR received and initial purchase order from the North America’s Limestone Boat Company for $2 million worth (25 units) of E-Motion 180E outboard motors and Powertrain systems. Limestone is now moving into scheduled production, with delivery target to dealers set to begin in 2024.

But the bigger picture is this: VMAR’s proprietary electric motor and powertrain system turns any boat into an electric boat, which makes its strategy to sell motors (not boats) to OEMs an incredibly savvy one in a market flooded with EV makers who are spending more money than they might ever make.

A Second, Disruptive Revenue Chain

VMAR also plans to plug in the boat rental market.

The global boat rental market (across all boat types) was valued at $18.2 billion in 2021, and is projected to reach $31.2 billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 5.7% from 2022 to 2031. It’s a huge market that is about to go electric.

And, again, VMAR has first-mover advantage.

VMAR’s flagship Newport business managed to serve 300,000 clients in the first three years, annualizing $4 million in revenues with a 35% profit margin.

For 2023, Vision Marine will be rolling out two more fully-owned electric boat rental locations and launching their franchise model.

By 2024, it’s expected to be full speed ahead with scaling.

The company’s proprietary technology gives it the opportunity to become one of the NASDAQ’s most exciting EV plays.

By the end of 2024, Vision Marine (NASDAQ:VMAR),  expects to be free-cash-flow positive, and by 2025, it expects to have two profitable and growing divisions, after which the scaling is expected to gain further momentum.

Other companies to keep an eye on:

Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) is a prominent player in the chip manufacturing and research sector. As the leading chip fabrication equipment maker, the company supplies advanced machinery to semiconductor production factories. Despite being overshadowed by other tech stocks, Applied Materials' significance in the industry cannot be ignored. The company's recent announcement about investing up to $4 billion in the EPIC Center demonstrates its commitment to testing new semiconductor technology and fostering industry collaboration.

Notable partners, including Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, AMD, and Intel, have expressed excitement about this initiative. The company's adaptability to focus on high-growth segments, such as chip fabs for electric vehicles and industrial technology, has contributed to a 6% increase in revenue and 7% rise in EPS in its most recent quarter. With shares trading at an appealing valuation, Applied Materials is an attractive prospect for investors looking for exposure to the chip sector's potential.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) remains a powerhouse in the tech industry despite a recent slowdown in revenue growth. With a dominant 92.8% share of the search market and a growing presence in the cloud market through Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Alphabet demonstrates its strong position. The company's diverse revenue streams, including digital advertising, cloud infrastructure, and streaming services, provide a solid foundation for future growth.

Additionally, Alphabet's commitment to innovation, integrating AI into various products and ventures like Waymo's autonomous driving, keeps the company at the forefront of technological advancements. Trading at approximately 17 times projected earnings in 2024 and with a projected annual increase of over 16% in per-share profits over the next five years, Alphabet offers an attractive investment opportunity for those seeking long-term growth prospects.

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), with a market capitalization of $2.8 trillion, stands as one of the most significant tech giants. The company's services segment, including Apple Music, Apple Pay, and Apple TV+, has witnessed remarkable growth and contributes to both financials and customer loyalty. Seamless integration between Apple's hardware and software ecosystem, combined with a vast user base of over 2 billion active Apple devices, fosters strong customer stickiness.

Apple's pricing power is evident, as it successfully raises prices for flagship products like the iPhone without significant demand impact. The company generates substantial free cash flow, enabling it to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. With proven resilience and a history of sustained growth, Apple remains an appealing choice for investors looking for a compelling long-term holding in the tech industry.

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) continues to dominate the e-commerce space with a commanding 38% share of online retail shopping in the U.S. The company's logistics and distribution capabilities further solidify its position as an industry leader. Additionally, Amazon's cloud infrastructure arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), holds a substantial 32% share of the cloud market, benefitting from the growing demand for on-demand cloud services. AWS's impressive operating margin of 28% contributes significantly to Amazon's overall profitability. The company's digital advertising business is also thriving, with a 23% increase in sales in the first quarter, making Amazon a strong player in the advertising space. With strategic investments in AI, exemplified by the launch of Bedrock within AWS, Amazon is well-prepared to leverage emerging technologies and maintain its market dominance. Trading at an attractive valuation and with multiple growth drivers, Amazon presents an enticing opportunity for investors looking for a market leader with a focus on AI initiatives.

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), formerly known as Facebook, has witnessed soaring stock prices, gaining nearly 120% in 2023. Despite already being a dominant player, the company continues to experience impressive growth, with 3.81 billion monthly active users across its Family of Apps. Meta's potential to monetize users outside the U.S. and Canada provides room for further revenue expansion. Reports suggest the company may be developing a decentralized alternative to Twitter, showcasing its commitment to innovation. Moreover, Meta's strong focus on leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance content recommendations and boost monetization positions it well for upcoming technological shifts. With a solid financial position, maintaining an average operating margin of 36.2% over the past five years and generating substantial free cash flow, Meta has the resources to drive further growth. These factors make Meta an appealing option for investors seeking a strong and forward-looking player in the social media and AI landscape.

IBM (NYSE: IBM), a tech giant with a history of resilience, has demonstrated consistent sales growth despite challenging market conditions. Its recent strategic restructuring efforts, including divestments and simplification of business segments, aim to streamline operations and fuel future growth. IBM's cloud business, especially through its subsidiary Red Hat, has been expanding, benefiting from a hybrid cloud approach that capitalizes on open-source software.

Leveraging its portfolio of AI services, IBM is well-positioned to tap into the growing AI market. Improving margins and rising cash flows, driven by cost-cutting measures and strategic initiatives, provide the company with ample resources to invest in hybrid cloud and AI sectors.

Investing in the stock market carries inherent risks, and it's essential to conduct thorough research and seek advice from a qualified financial professional before making any investment decisions.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) stands as a diverse tech powerhouse with renowned brands like Windows, Office, Xbox, and LinkedIn. Its leadership across various tech sectors has translated into remarkable stock growth, making it an attractive investment option. Microsoft's strategic foray into artificial intelligence (AI) has further strengthened its investment appeal. The company's early investments in OpenAI, totaling $11 billion, have positioned it as a leader in the burgeoning AI market.

By integrating OpenAI's technologies across its platforms, Microsoft has become a go-to provider of AI services. Collaborations with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in AI chip development demonstrate the company's dedication to optimizing AI offerings and performance. Furthermore, Microsoft's success in the gaming industry with Xbox Game Pass, a subscription-based service with access to a vast library of games, has attracted millions of subscribers and transformed the Xbox console into a cost-effective option. With Microsoft's track record of growth and continuous innovation, it remains a compelling choice for investors seeking stability and long-term potential in the tech sector.

Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO) is a networking giant specializing in networking hardware, telecoms equipment, and IT services and products. The company's strong financial position, with $23.3 billion in cash and equivalents plus short-term investments, provides opportunities for potential acquisitions and growth.

Cisco's focus on artificial intelligence software and a shift towards subscription-based software and services contribute to its long-term growth prospects. The company has shown decent performance in 2023, with a year-to-date rise of approximately 10%, driven by growth in its core networking business and improved supply chain conditions.

Cisco's recent revision of full-year guidance, anticipating higher sales growth, indicates strong demand, particularly in the commercial and enterprise sectors. With a solid 3% dividend yield, Cisco is considered by many investors as a strong long-term hold with limited downside risk.

Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), a notable player in the e-commerce software industry, has exhibited signs of recovery and is poised for brighter days ahead. The company reported impressive financial figures in the first quarter of 2023, with revenue and monthly recurring revenue (MRR) increasing significantly year-over-year. MRR provides Shopify with a stable and predictable revenue stream, essential for subscription-based businesses.

With a strategic decision to focus on its core e-commerce software offerings, Shopify aims to enhance its gross profit margin and allocate resources efficiently. This renewed focus on e-commerce software, coupled with its solid track record, makes Shopify a potential candidate to deliver substantial value to investors in the long run.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) presents a compelling case for investors seeking exposure to the semiconductor industry. While competing against industry giants like Nvidia, AMD offers significant upside potential and a less risky investment option. The company's continuous efforts to capture market share from Intel in the CPU markets for computers and servers, as well as challenging Nvidia in the AI space, position it well for future growth. AMD's partnership with Microsoft in AI chip development and subsequent launch of the MI300 accelerator processing unit demonstrate its commitment to driving performance and data center growth. The company's potential for market share gains, positive demand catalysts, and AI-related partnerships make it an enticing investment opportunity in the semiconductor sector.

As always, it's important for investors to conduct thorough research and consult with financial professionals before making any investment decisions. The stock market carries inherent risks, and individual circumstances and risk tolerance should be taken into consideration when making investment choices.

2023-07-31T23:04:21+00:00,12 Worst Performing Fast Food Chains In America,"In this article, we will be covering the 12 Worst Performing Fast Food Chains In America. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the fast food and quick service restaurant sector, you can go directly to the 5 Worst Performing Fast Food Chains In America.

Over the past few decades, fast food has become an important part of life in the United States. Not surprisingly, the fast food and quick service restaurant business is extremely competitive today. People are always looking for food that is inexpensive, appealing, full of taste, and fast.

A number of fast food chains and quick service restaurants in America have become institutions over the years. With new competition, sometimes the old players are pushed out. And sometimes the new ones don’t really have what it takes to make it in the fast and competitive fast food industry. In this article, we will be looking at 12 fast food restaurant chains in the US that have the highest number of restaurant locations closures, but first let’s take a look at the fast food and quick service restaurant industry.

The Fast Food and Quick Service Restaurant Industry to Reach $320 Billion

Previously, the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 led to some of the biggest restaurant chains to file for bankruptcies in 2020. Food delivery services and online ordering helped some of the biggest fast food companies stay alive during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In one of our previous articles, 25 Most Valuable Food Companies in The World, we also discussed briefly how the food industry is currently facing challenges with regards to food safety concerns. However, we mentioned that the continuously growing global population remains one of the key drivers of growth in the food and restaurant industry.

According to Research and Markets, the global fast food and quick service restaurant market was valued at $243.9 billion in the year 2022. The highly competitive market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.7% during 2023-2028, reaching $319.7 billion by the end of the forecasted period. Inclination of consumers, mainly millennials, towards fast food items and ready-to-eat meals is one of the biggest factors that is expected to help the market to flourish in the coming years. The increasing working population and their hectic schedules have significantly heightened the consumption of fast food in a number of countries around the world. The demand for fast food and quick service items is on the rise, and this remains one of the key factors creating a more positive outlook for the market. In addition to this, factors such as digitization and modernization of the restaurant outlets, combined with the utilization of digital sales terminals and touchscreen kiosks, are expected to further augment market growth.

Some restaurant and food company stocks that are expected to become a popular choice during this period include McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG), and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX).

While the global food and restaurant industry was one of the hardest hit by the COVID-19 crisis, signs of recovery continue to create a positive outlook for the market as some of the biggest names in the industry shift their focus towards growth. On March 6, Reuters reported that Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) will be looking to open as many as 100 new outlets in the UK. The corporation is reportedly on track to invest GBP 30 million in their UK operations for the launch of new locations as well as renovation of their more than 1000 already existing outlets.

With regards to the market in China, here are some comments from Starbucks Corporation’s (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q2 2023 earnings call:

“Moving on to China. Q2 marked a significant turning point when we finally began to emerge from 3 years of unprecedented COVID disruptions, embarking on the recovery journey that we have envisioned. We saw a robust recovery in Q2, reinforcing the resilience of our partners, the strength of our brand and the close relationships that we have built with our customers.

We experienced faster-than-expected recovery, closing the quarter with nearly $800 million in revenue, up 3% from the prior year and up 11%, excluding the 8% impact of foreign currency translation. Comp growth of 3% marked the first positive comp since the third quarter of fiscal year 2021.

Importantly, we accelerated our store development in the quarter, opening 153 net new stores, more than doubling the net new stores in the previous quarter. We now operate over 6,200 stores across 244 cities, keeping us on track to meet our goal of 9,000 stores by 2025. Our bold decision to continue opening new stores over the past 3 years, despite COVID disruptions and mobility restrictions, is paying off as they continue to deliver returns and profitability.”

However, global inflation and rising food prices has caused problems for some of the top contenders in the fast food industry. Despite being one of thebiggest fast food companies in the world, Subway had to close more than a thousand of their locations in the US in recent years. On May 1, Reuters published anarticle that claimed that the Subway chain of restaurants declined by 2.7% in the US due to closures in 2022.

On the other hand, on July 24, Reuters posted that restaurant chains like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) are set to report strong earnings in the fiscal second half of this year as the prices of commodities such as chicken and dairy have eased. The post also claims that data from Placer.ai showed that visits to McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) increased by 8.4% in the second quarter, while visits to Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) rose by 15.7%.

On July 27, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $3.17, beating the EPS estimates by $0.38. The company reported a revenue of $6.5 billion and surpassed revenue estimates by $202.69 million. 12 Worst Performing Fast Food Chains In America

This sector has the potential to transform various industries, particularly manufacturing and healthcare by creating new opportunities for growth and efficiency. Robotics also offers a competitive edge for investors who are looking to balance long-term returns with exposure to cutting-edge technologies. Below are three high potential robotics stocks that I think are about to have a significant rally in share price.

Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)

Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) is the pioneer and market leader in robotic-assisted surgery. The company’s flagship product, the da Vinci Surgical System, enables surgeons to perform minimally invasive procedures with enhanced precision, control and dexterity. The system has been used in over 13 million surgeries across various specialties such as urology, gynecology, general surgery and cardiothoracic surgery.

Intuitive has a strong competitive advantage due to its high-quality products, extensive patent portfolio and global distribution network. The robotics company’s revenue model also embeds a lucrative recurring element. This is tied to the services and operational leases related to the da Vinci product. ISRG also invests prudently but consistently in research and development to continue improving upon its technology and expanding its applications.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

On July 20, ISRG released its Q2 2023 earnings and beat Wall Street analysts’ expectations on both revenue and EPS estimates. However, since the company noted new weight loss drugs were possibly eating into the growth in bariatric procedures, a target procedure for the business, the company’s stock stumbled. Because Intuitive Surgical’s core product growth remains impressive, this could be an attractive buying opportunity for investors before shares rally again.

Zebra Technologies (NASDAQ:ZBRA) is a leading provider of enterprise asset intelligence solutions, such as barcode scanners, printers, RFID tags, mobile computers and software. The company’s products ultimately help businesses track and manage their assets, data and workflows across various industries, such as retail, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing.

The amalgamation of these diverse products with targeted end-markets have culminated in Zebra Technologies having a strong position in the growing market for enterprise asset intelligence solutions. This is bolstered by strong performance in Q1 2023 when the company beat analysts’ expectations.

Though Zebra’s main focus is not building fancy robots, its value-add to enterprise supply chains makes it vital to many businesses’ digital transformation efforts, and thus a good pick for investors wanting exposure to robotics, automation, and supply chain management solutions.

Teradyne (TER) Teradyne Silicon Valley office

Teradyne (NASDAQ: TER) is a leading provider of automated test equipment for semiconductors, electronics, wireless devices and industrial automation. The company’s products help ensure the quality and performance of various devices and systems that power the modern world. The company’s robotics segments consist of Universal Robots, a leading supplier of collaborative robotic arms, and Mobile Industrial Robots, a leading maker of autonomous robots for industrial purposes.

Because Teradyne is both a supplier of robotics parts and a provider of autonomous robots, the company’s revenue streams are quite diversified. A strong position in the fast-growing semiconductor testing market also helps to offset any potential slack in the robotics segment. For example, in its Q2 2023 earnings Teradyne’s semiconductor testing segment stole the show. While the company surpassed both revenue and profits estimates, the robotics giant was aided by increased demand for semiconductors that power AI processes. For the quarter, TER reported revenue of $684 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of 79 cents.

The company’s stock has been performing well this year, rising over 30% so far. With spectacular AI-driven growth in Teradyne’s semiconductor testing business, the industrial robotics firm most likely has more untapped growth potential in the future.

The relationship between insider trading activity and stock price can provide valuable insights into the company's performance and future prospects. In this case, the consistent selling activity by insiders, including Robert Desantis, could suggest that they believe the stock is currently overvalued or that they expect the company's performance to decline in the future.

Valuation

On the day of Robert Desantis's recent sell, shares of Intuitive Surgical Inc were trading at $323.26, giving the company a market cap of $115.1 billion.

The stock's price-earnings ratio is 82.10, significantly higher than the industry median of 30.11 and the company's historical median price-earnings ratio. This suggests that the stock may be overvalued compared to its peers and its own historical performance.

However, according to the GuruFocus Value, which is calculated based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates, the stock is fairly valued. With a price of $323.26 and a GuruFocus Value of $354.13, the stock has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.91.

In conclusion, while the insider selling activity and high price-earnings ratio may raise some concerns, the GuruFocus Value suggests that the stock is fairly valued. Investors should carefully consider these factors and conduct further research before making investment decisions.

2023-07-27T13:42:27+00:00,7 Millionaire-Maker Healthcare Stocks to Buy Before the Window Closes,"Healthcare continues to be a major industry and economic driver around the world. According to the American Medical Association, spending on healthcare in the U.S. totals more than $4 trillion each year, which works out to nearly $13,000 per person. And the amount being spent on health is forecast to continue rising in coming years as the American population ages. By 2028, the U.S. is expected to be spending more than $6 trillion a year on healthcare, representing an increase of 50% in only five years. This makes healthcare stocks a fairly safe bet for buy-and-hold investors. Long-term, few stocks are likely to outperform those in the healthcare sector. This includes stocks of pharmaceutical companies, health insurers, medical device manufacturers, and firms involved in the growing field of virtual medicine. As the medical sector grows dramatically, we offer up seven millionaire-maker healthcare stocks to buy before the window closes.

Danaher Corp. (NYSE:DHR), which makes highly technical and life-saving medical devices, just reported second-quarter earnings, and, as usual, the company beat Wall Street forecasts on both the top and bottom lines. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.05, which was better than the consensus expectation of analysts for earnings of $2 a share. Revenue for Q2 came in at $7.16 billion, which was also above Wall Street forecasts of $7.11 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

It was the fourth consecutive quarter in which Danaher beat Street forecasts for its earnings per share. Yet, in a cruel twist of fate, Danaher’s stock fell after the latest earnings print due to weaker-than-expected free cash flow. Danaher said that its Q2 free cash flow amounted to $1.59 billion, which was below consensus analyst forecasts of $1.73 billion. DHR stock is now down 7% over the last 12 months. Investors should see it as a buy-the-dip opportunity. In the last five years, the stock has risen nearly 150%.

Healthcare and pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) also just reported better-than-expected Q2 earnings and raised its full-year guidance as sales in its MedTech business unit strengthened. Johnson & Johnson reported EPS of $2.80 versus $2.62 that had been expected on Wall Street. In the quarter ended June 30, revenue amounted to $25.53 billion compared to $24.62 billion, which was expected among analysts tracking the company’s progress.

Johnson & Johnson said in its earnings print that it is benefitting from a rebound in non-urgent surgeries among older adults who had deferred many procedures during the pandemic. Consequently, the company raised its forward guidance, saying it now expects full-year revenue of $98.8 billion to $99.8 billion, which is about $1 billion higher than previous guidance. The company also raised its 2023 earnings outlook, saying it expects EPS of $10.70 to $10.80, up from a previous range of $10.60 to $10.70 a share.

JNJ stock has been flat over the last 12 months (up 0.02%), and it pays a quarterly dividend of $1.19 a share for a decent yield of 2.76%.

UnitedHealth Group (UNH) United Health Stock

Another company that just crushed its Q2 print is UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), the largest health insurer in the U.S. The company, which is bigger than the largest banks in America, reported an EPS of $6.14 versus the $5.99 that had been expected on the Street. Revenue for the quarter came in at $92.9 billion compared to consensus estimates of $91.01 billion. UnitedHealth attributed the earnings beat to its $8 billion acquisition of the healthcare technology company Change Healthcare, as well as a spike in the number of patients served.

The typically strong earnings underscore why UNH stock is a long-term winner for investors. Over the last five years, UNH stock has effectively doubled. The company’s share price has gained more than 600% during the past decade. Looking ahead, the company lifted the low end of its full-year earnings outlook to EPS of $24.70 to $25, up from a previous forecast of $24.50 to $25.00 per share. With its size and earning power, UNH is one of the best healthcare stocks to buy and hold.

McKesson Corp. (NYSE:MCK) is another huge U.S. healthcare company that has a track record of delivering strong returns to stockholders. The company delivers a third of all pharmaceuticals used in the U.S. and Canada and also provides health information technology, medical supplies, and care management tools. Today, McKesson has nearly 80,000 employees and annual revenues approaching $300 billion. The company also runs a retail chain of pharmacies within Canada.

MCK stock has had a bumpy ride over the last year as the company was caught up in the opioid crisis and related financial settlements. This year, McKesson’s share price is up 10%, trailing the S&P 500 index’s gain of nearly 20%. However, through five years, MCK stock is up 232%, proving that it is a healthcare stock to buy. Currently trading at 16 times future earnings and with a quarterly dividend payout of 62 cents a share, McKesson’s stock has a lot to recommend it.

If there’s one healthcare stock to make your millionaire dreams come true, it is pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY). The company’s share price has been running circles around other pharma stocks this year on growing excitement over Mounjaro, or Tirzepatide as it is also known, a medication that treats Type 2 Diabetes but has also been found to cause dramatic weight loss in people, opening the door for it to be used to treat obesity.

The company anticipates getting approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to sell Mounjaro as a weight loss treatment by year’s end. Some analysts are confidently forecasting that Mounjaro will be the biggest blockbuster drug of all time. Several analysts have raised their price targets on LLY stock recently, including Morgan Stanley, which maintained a “buy” rating and lifted its target on the stock to $560, implying a 23% upside from current levels. LLY stock has gained 38% in the last 12 months.

Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.

Another buy-the-dip candidate can be found in Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG), the company that makes robotic instruments for minimally invasive surgical procedures. ISRG stock has dropped 8% since the company recently posted Q2 earnings. The decline is disappointing given that the company beat Wall Street forecasts across the board, reporting EPS of $1.42 and revenue of $1.76 billion, which beat expectations of $1.33 in earnings on $1.74 billion in revenue, according to Refinitiv data.

ISRG stock fell after the Q2 print because the company’s systems unit revenue came in lighter than forecast at $392.7 million, missing consensus estimates for $415.9 million. However, the dip presents a gift to investors who can now take a position in ISRG stock at a favorable price. Despite the recent drop, Intuitive Surgical’s stock is still up 25% this year, has increased 53% over the last 12 months, and has gained more than 90% through five years. Make no mistake. This is a millionaire-maker healthcare stock.

Teladoc Health (TDOC) The Teladoc logo through a magnifying glass.

Investors with an appetite for risk should consider Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC). The company behind telemedicine and virtual doctor appointments was a darling during the pandemic as healthcare consultations were forced online. Coming out of the global health emergency though, TDOC stock has cratered as patient visits plunged and investors soured on the company and its business model. Teladoc shares are now trading 93% below the all-time high they reached in Feb. 2021, just before the pandemic trade reversed.

Another issue facing TDOC stock is poor earnings and a lack of profits at the company. However, in this area, Teladoc Health has made major strides. The company just reported Q2 earnings that showed its revenue rose 10% year-over-year to $652.4 million, which was in line with consensus estimates. More importantly, the company’s net loss narrowed dramatically to $65.2 million from $3.1 billion in the same quarter of 2022. TDOC stock is down 43% in the last 12 months. But the share price jumped 7% higher on the Q2 print. Time to buy the dip.

Over the past two decades, the staffing industry has seen a rapid change. Gone are the days of aggressively searching newspapers and paper-postings to find employment opportunities. With stratospheric adoption of technology, human resource processes have drastically changed. Given this metamorphosis, businesses now face an unprecedented set of opportunities and challenges. Another major post pandemic change has been the demand for greater work flexibility by employers and employees. Following this, there is a strong expectation for freelance work opportunities to increase. Over the years, freelance platforms have presented a competitive ecosystem where businesses can attract candidates better suited to their needs. Furthermore, as remote work seems to be increasing, experts expect the market for staffing solutions to grow in accordance. With firms looking to outsource more human resource related affairs, competition is only expected to grow in the staffing sector.

Another major development has been the inclusion of artificial intelligence in various professions. With companies such as Oracle working on developing AI to enhance innovation in business, McKinseyexpects staffing companies to take a similar approach by incorporating AI in their cloud-based human resource platforms. A survey by Gartner reported that while only 17% of total staffing companies used AI in 2019, the percentage was set to increase to over 30% by the end of 2022. Although AI can be incorporated in various staffing procedures, it presents a series of challenges as well. The biggest challenge would be the funding costs for development and integration of AI in processes. Safety, security, and privacy are other concerns that are inherently built into AI exploration. Another technical issue could be integrating new features into currently used systems. Needless to say, there is a room for a lot of innovation in the industry.

In 2021, the PGC Group reported that the staffing industry in the United States approximately grew by 28% to generate sales in excess of $186.9 billion. It was also reported that the sector had outgrown market expectations by $6 billion. In terms of market size, the US market dominates the industry. As per IBIS World, the total market for the human resources and staffing industry can potentially exceed $760 billion in 2023.

Investors looking to diversify their holdings and benefit from the growth opportunity in the human resources and staffing market can check out stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY), and Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP).

10. ManpowerGroup Inc. (NYSE:MAN)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19

ManpowerGroup Inc. (NYSE:MAN) is a global provider of recruitment and hiring services. Be it Europe, Asia, or the Middle East, the company is engaged with all kinds of businesses to scout the best talent. ManpowerGroup Inc. (NYSE:MAN) provides services regarding permanent and temporary employment. In addition, ManpowerGroup Inc. (NYSE:MAN) also offers employee assessments, reviews and training. On May 5, the company declared an increase in dividend payments by 8.1% to $1.47 per share. ManpowerGroup reported a Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $1.58 on July 20, missing Street estimates by $0.03. However, revenue for the period came in at $4.9 billion, beating market consensus by $40 million.

According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, a total of 19 hedge funds were bullish on ManpowerGroup Inc. (NYSE:MAN), as opposed to 20 in the last quarter of 2022. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management holds the largest position in the company, with 1.2 million shares worth $97.4 million.

Here is what Palm Valley Capital Management has to say about ManpowerGroup Inc. (NYSE:MAN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:

“We acquired four new positions during the quarter—two of these were recycled. The Fund bought back Kelly Services (NASDAQ:KELYA), a prior holding, and established a new weighting in ManpowerGroup (NYSE:MAN). Both companies serve the staffing industry. Staffing is cyclical, and we expect results for these companies to deteriorate in a recession, even though margins haven’t fully recovered yet from the lockdowns. In our judgment, during previous downturns, their operating performance was acceptable for a cyclical trough. We believe the valuations for Kelly and Manpower are becoming increasingly compelling. Kelly trades at a 46% discount to tangible book value. The company’s net assets are primarily supported by a mountain of receivables. Neither Kelly nor Manpower experienced significant credit losses during the last recession. ManpowerGroup’s $4 billion Enterprise Value is 6.7x its five-year average operating income before amortization, which includes a trough in 2020. Manpower is based in the U.S., but it earns the majority of revenues from Europe. We think the firm’s European exposure has placed it in the doghouse among investors, given the unique risks facing those economies. Manpower’s translated results are also weighed down by the rocketing U.S. dollar…” (Click here to see the full text)

9. Insperity, Inc. (NYSE:NSP)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21

Insperity, Inc. (NYSE:NSP) focuses on optimizing and synchronizing the workforce for small and medium sized businesses.

On May 24, the company declared a 10% increase in the dividend per share, which now stands at $0.57. The dividend was distributed to stakeholders on June 22. Insperity, Inc. (NYSE:NSP) also beat Q1 top and bottom line estimates.

According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 21 hedge funds were bullish on Insperity, Inc. (NYSE:NSP). In comparison to the last quarter of 2022, this number remains unchanged. Anthony Bozza’s Lakewood Capital Management holds the largest stake in the company, comprising 358,063 shares worth $43.5 million.

Lakewood Capital Management had this to say about Insperity, Inc. (NYSE:NSP) in its Q2 2020 investor letter:

“Earlier this year, the fund initiated a position in Insperity, a provider of outsourced human resources for small- and medium-sized businesses. We began purchasing shares in February as the stock declined significantly following disappointing earnings and guidance related to an unusual spike in employee benefit costs. Subsequent share price declines during the March stock market sell-off, primarily due to concerns about the health of the company’s core customer base, allowed us to purchase additional shares in a high-quality, growing and cash generative business at an extremely discounted valuation.

Insperity operates what is called a Professional Employer Organization (PEO), whereby it serves as the co-employer for around 240,000 worksite employees (WSEs) across almost 9,000 companies. Insperity provides a wide range of human resources offerings to its clients and uses its position as a large “employer” to negotiate lower benefit pricing (including health insurance and workers’ compensation) than its clients would be able to obtain individually. This model has proven remarkably successful, with Insperity growing WSEs by 9% annually since 1999, while expanding gross profit and EBIT during the same period by 11% and 15% per annum, respectively. We believe there is a long runway for growth...” (Click here to see the full text)

8. Robert Half Inc. (NYSE:RHI)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21

Robert Half Inc. (NYSE:RHI) specializes in providing human resources solutions across the globe. With presence in America, Europe, and the Middle East, the company focuses on three major segments – Contract Talent Solutions, Permanent Placement Talent Solutions, and Protiviti. The first segment focuses on talent engagement in fields such as finance, technology, creative, and legal advisory. The second segment focuses on full-time employment for accounting, finance, taxation, and compliance professionals. Lastly, the Protiviti segment aims to provide business consulting services in finance, regulatory compliance, legal consultation, digital transformations, and internal audits. Robert Half Inc. (NYSE:RHI) is one of the best human resources stocks to buy.

On July 25, Robert Half Inc. (NYSE:RHI) fell short of Wall Street estimates for Q2 revenue by $50 million and the EPS by $0.12. However, the company paid a $0.48 per share  dividend to shareholders in June 2023. Dividend payments for the quarter amounted to $51 million.

FMI made the following comment about Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE:RHI) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE:RHI) is the market leader in professional staffing for small and medium sized businesses. The company has a premier temporary and permanent placement franchise in the field of accounting (Accountemps) and finance, while its Protiviti business has become a strong domestic and international consultancy. RHI’s reinvestment in technology, including its national database, candidate performance scoring, and proprietary AI and matching capabilities are driving share gains versus fragmented competition. The business model is asset-light and generates consistently strong returns-on-capital, industry leading margins, and free cash flow. The less cyclical Protiviti business accounts for 30% of income. Capital allocation at RHI has been focused on reinvestment, share repurchases, and dividend increases. These factors should result in less overall cyclicality in EPS going forward. The shares are off 40% from its 2022 highs. We feel that the discounted valuation is reflective of current recession worries, which could lower demand for labor. Additionally, there are concerns around AI and the disruption that it could have on accounting. Our view is that the sentiment around the latter appears overdone, as demand for accountants has increased over time despite major advances in productivity tools.”

7. Korn Ferry (NYSE:KFY)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27

Korn Ferry (NYSE:KFY) is a global provider of consultancy services.

“Korn Ferry (NYSE:KFY) is a global organization consulting firm that has benefited from strong labor demand. After exceeding expectations for more than a year, the company fell short in the most recent quarter as strong top line growth finally moderated. With economic conditions deteriorating around the world, investors may also anticipate additional deceleration.”

Here is what Spree Capital Advisers has to say about Upwork Inc. in their Investor Letter:

“Early in the fourth quarter we meaningfully increased our position size in Upwork (UPWK). Upwork is a global employment marketplace that enables businesses to vet, hire, and manage talent as part of their distributed workforce. Upwork facilitates labor and demand side connectivity on a global scale by providing the infrastructure to create trust and to streamline talent sourcing, contracting, analysis and payment. Freelancers benefit from having a reputation ranking system that feeds their marketing channels, allowing them to have access to quality, flexible work and on time compensation. Businesses on the demand side benefit by having extensive access to specialized talent, enabling faster and more cost effective hiring, and by having the strategic optionality inherent in the ability to flex a portion of their workforce based on changing demand requirements.

Labor markets have long had unnecessary frictional inefficiencies driven by regional talent imbalances and long-term trends of increased specialization of labor and declining labor mobility. Meanwhile, innovations in communication and global connectivity have transformed the way work gets done. Knowledge workers seek the flexibility and geographic advantages of on demand work, but the barrier to adoption…” (Click here to see the full text)

Presentation

Operator

Good morning. My name is Michelle, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. After prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Danyal Hussain

Thank you, Michelle, and welcome everyone to ADP's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. Participating today are Maria Black, our President and CEO; and Don McGuire, our CFO.
Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter and full year. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call.
During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release.
Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.
I'll now turn it over to Maria.

Maria Black

Thank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We closed out the year with a strong fourth quarter that included 9% organic constant currency revenue growth, 270 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion and 26% adjusted EPS growth. And for our full year fiscal 2023, we delivered 10% organic constant currency revenue growth, 130 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion and 17% adjusted EPS growth representing another strong year for ADP.
I'll start with some highlights from the quarter. Our worldwide sales and marketing team delivered exceptional Q4 Employer Services, new business Bookings growth that was well in excess of our expectations with strong double-digit overall growth on top of a difficult comparison. The HCM demand environment has been healthy despite a gradually slowing macroeconomic backdrop, and we have been capitalizing on this study demand.
Our strong bookings results were broad-based. We had continued strength in our down market and Employer Services HRO offerings, we also had better-than-expected results in our mid-market as well as a great finish from our compliance and international businesses. This Q4 performance brought our full year Employer Services bookings growth to 10% compared to our 6% to 9% guidance and our medium-term goal of 7% to 8% growth that we laid out at our 2021 Investor Day. We are, of course, thrilled with this result and excited to keep the momentum going.
Our Employer Services retention rate was another highlight in Q4 and came in better than we expected. For the full year, we delivered a retention rate increase of 10 basis points and are back to our record level retention rate of 92.2%, all while absorbing the impact of normalization in the down market out of business rates. This strong result was driven by record-level retention rates, specifically in our U.S. mid-market and international businesses and by record level overall client satisfaction across our major businesses in the fourth quarter.
Our Employer Services pays per control growth was 3% for the quarter as the overall labor market continued to show resilience, bringing the full year pays per control figure to 5%. We have been pleased all year to see such durable labor demand from our clients. And last, while our PEO revenue growth performed in line with our expectations this quarter, we were pleased to experience a further acceleration in PEO bookings with strong double-digit growth in Q4, representing another record level sales quarter.
Moving on, while Don will cover our fiscal 2024 financial outlook, I wanted to spend a few minutes sharing our strategic priorities as we look ahead. Change and increase in complexity are secular growth drivers for the HCM industry. And our breadth enables us to address nearly any HCM challenge our clients may face and meet them wherever they may be on their HR journey. From start-up to enterprise, from software-only to fully outsourced, and from local to global, we see a tremendous growth opportunity in front of us. And while our specific growth initiatives will vary by business, there are 3 key strategic priorities, which apply across all of ADP that I see as critical to enabling our growth in the years ahead.
The first strategic priority is to lead with best-in-class HCM technology, put simply, our goal is to design, develop and deliver the very best and most innovative solutions that will help our clients navigate the full life cycle of employment. From hiring employees to onboarding and training them, providing insurance for them, paying them and filing payroll taxes and even setting them up for retirement. 
As much as we offer today, we see an incredible opportunity to improve on our current and next-gen solutions, tactically used partnerships and inorganic means to further accelerate our pace of innovation and continues to offer industry-leading HCM products, and we expect to have a busy fiscal 2024. For U.S. small businesses, we are rolling out several product enhancements that will serve our 850,000 RUN clients, including a new tax ID registration, service-learning management to help with small business employee training and an insurance inspector tool that utilizes AI to help clients manage their workers' compensation, insurance policies and annual audits.
For U.S. midsized businesses served by Workforce Now, our focus is to continue our great momentum in the deployment of our Next Gen Payroll and time engine and to drive our win rates and client satisfaction even higher. In the U.S. enterprise space, we expect to nearly finish the migrations of 3 of our remaining legacy platforms by the end of this fiscal year representing an important step in our multiyear journey to move our clients to more modern platforms.
We are also pleased to have advanced the velocity of our Next Gen HCM implementations, and we expect our Next Gen HCM sales to contribute in a more meaningful way to our bookings growth in fiscal 2024. Outside the U.S., we intend to scale our iHCM mid-market platform in fiscal 2024, adding at least 1,000 clients over the course of the year. I am also incredibly excited to share that we will begin offering role outside the U.S. in fiscal 2024 to drive incremental growth.
We plan to launch initially in 2 countries in Europe and expand its reach from there, and we intend to continue growing our Asia Pacific business, in part by leveraging our recent acquisition of a strong mid-market time product to supplement our existing payroll functionality. And across a few of our platforms, including Workforce Now and Roll, we intend to deploy Gen AI-powered features to help our clients more quickly and easily tackle certain HR transactions.
Our second strategic priority is to provide unmatched expertise and outsourcing to our clients. We pride ourselves on serving as a true partner to each and every one of our 1 million clients. Our culture of client service applies equally across our entire business, from a basic payroll client to a fully outsourced client where we run part or all of the HR department. Our expertise and partnership approach has been key to ADP's winning formula for decades, and we will continue to lean into it. We expect that to manifest in a few ways in fiscal 2024.
We have recently been piloting a number of tools powered by Gen AI that can help our service and implementation associates deliver an even better client experience, and we will begin deploying these more broadly in early fiscal 2024. Given the significant number of clients we onboard and interact with every year, we expect to learn quite a bit this year about the longer-term benefits we and our clients might realize from Gen AI.
Meanwhile, demand for our HR outsourcing solutions remains very strong. And in fiscal 2024, we are focused on reaching new clients and further improving the experience for existing ones. Our Employer Services HRO businesses have been performing incredibly well, and our focus for fiscal 2024 is to continue delivering strong bookings and keep client satisfaction and retention at current levels, or perhaps even reach new record levels. And our focus for our PEO business in fiscal 2024 is to maintain our recent strong bookings momentum by continuing to add to our sales force headcount, grow our referral partner network, and use data and machine learning to identify existing ADP clients who may be a strong fit for an upgrade.
Our third and final strategic priority is to leverage our global scale for the benefit of our clients. Our size and scale are unmatched in the industry. Across the globe, we not only offer robust platforms and a commitment to industry-leading service and expertise, but we also provide a scaled ecosystem and a unique on-the-ground presence in over 30 countries. This combination positions us to interact routinely with local governments and tax authorities, meet stringent certification and data requirements, and stay on top of complex and shifting legal requirements.
Globally, we bring together our incredible data in array of partners and integrated solutions in one of the biggest and best business-to-business sales forces in the world to help our clients and prospects navigate the changing world of work. In fiscal 2024, we will continue to build on that scale for the benefit of our clients. Our GlobalView platform supports hundreds of the world's largest multinational companies with scaled workforces in over 40 countries, and our Celergo platform helps us serve thousands more in up to 140 countries.
In fiscal 2024, we expect to expand on both as we add additional countries to GlobalView's broad reach and as we potentially make tuck-in acquisitions to enhance our native in-country footprint. After establishing an ADP in-country presence in 5 new markets in 2023, we expect to expand further in fiscal 2024. Our world-class global scale distribution, led by over 8,500 sellers is being supported by headcount and marketing investment in 2024, and as we've shared with you in the past few quarters, our sellers will continue to be paired with a best-in-class sales tech stack, which we plan to enhance with Gen AI functionality in the coming months. And our ability to provide data-driven insights will continue to grow in fiscal 2024.
ADP serves more clients and pay more people around the world than ever. And as we continue growing the number of employees we serve globally, the power of our insights will likewise continue to increase and benefit our clients. I am incredibly excited about these 3 strategic priorities for ADP, and the differentiation and growth they will continue to drive.
But before turning it over to Don, I wanted to take a moment to recognize our associates for their effort and performance over the course of this year. Our associates and body are core values like insightful expertise, service excellence and being results driven. In fiscal 2023, ADP was recognized as the world's most admired company by Fortune Magazine for the 17th consecutive year, signifying the incredibly strong culture we have and the important role we play in the world.
Additionally, we were recently recognized for the first time as one of the best companies for innovators by Fast Company, a true testament to the direction we are headed in. We owe these accolades as well as our strong, consistent financial performance to the commitment and effort of our 63,000 associates that make up the ADP family.
With that, I'll turn it over to Don.

Don Edward McGuire

Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by expanding on Maria's comments around our Q4 results and then cover our fiscal 2024 financial outlook. Q4 performance was very strong overall, driving fiscal '23 results at or above our expectations. As Maria mentioned, these results reflected broad-based strength in Employer Services and PEO new business bookings, better-than-anticipated Employer Services retention and continued healthy Employer Services pays per control growth yielding 10% organic constant currency revenue growth for the year, and bringing us to $18 billion in revenue.
For our Employer Services segment, revenue in the quarter increased 11% on both the reported and organic constant currency basis. This stronger-than-expected revenue growth was a function of continued outperformance in retention and pays per control growth as well as a better than anticipated contribution from client funds interest. Our ES margin expanded 480 basis points in the fourth quarter, which was broadly in line with our expectations.
For the full year, our ES revenue grew 10% on a reported basis and 11% on an organic constant currency basis, and our ES margin expanded 190 basis points. Growth in client funds interest helped us in a year in which we added a fair amount to our product, service and sales headcount, which has driven some fairly substantial benefits in sales, Net Promoter Score and retention results.
For our PEO, revenue increased 4% for the quarter, decelerating slightly from Q3 as we anticipated. Average worksite employees increased 3% on a year-over-year basis to 722,000 and has started to gradually reaccelerate supported by very strong bookings growth in Q4. PEO margin contracted 110 basis points in the fourth quarter, in line with our expectations due in part to higher selling expenses. For the full year, our PEO revenue grew 8% and average worksite employees increased 6% and our margin expanded 60 basis points, all in line with our most recent guidance.
I'll now turn to our outlook for fiscal '24. While the economic backdrop remains uncertain, we continue to believe we are well positioned to deliver solid overall financial results while also investing for future growth, consistent with the strategic priorities that Maria laid out. Our fiscal '24 outlook assumes some moderation in economic activity over the course of the year, but nothing dramatic.
Beginning with ES segment revenue, we expect growth of 7% to 8%, driven by the following key assumptions. We expect ES new business bookings growth of 4% to 7%, representing a solid growth after a particularly strong fiscal '23. For now, we're assuming a stronger first half and some moderation in second half bookings growth, which we think is prudent given the limited visibility into the macro environment.
For ES retention, we finished fiscal '23 at a record level of 92.2%, consistently outperforming our expectations throughout the year. We are, of course, very pleased with this performance as we overcame headwinds from higher down market out of business levels with strength elsewhere. With that said, we are contemplating a 50 to 70 basis points ES retention decline for fiscal '24 due in part to an assumption that small business losses will increase slightly from where they are today as well as an assumption for general impact to our other businesses from a slowing economic backdrop.
As we called out 3 months ago, we see the potential for below normal pays per control growth in fiscal '24, and our outlook assumes 1% to 2% growth for the year. We had a strong Q4, which gives us a solid starting point for growth and a gradual deceleration over the course of the year feels reasonable at this time. And as the price contributed 150 basis points to our ES revenue growth in fiscal '23, we are anticipating a smaller contribution in fiscal '24, though still above our recent historical average contribution of around 50 basis points.
And for client funds interest revenue, the interest rate backdrop has been dynamic these past few months, and it is important to keep in mind that our client funds interest revenue forecast reflects the current forward yield curve, which will, of course, evolve as we move through fiscal '24. At this point, we expect our average yield to increase from 2.4% in fiscal '23 to 2.8% in fiscal '24. We meanwhile expect our average client funds balances to grow 2% to 3% in fiscal '24. This is a bit lower than recent trends due primarily to more modest contribution from pays per control growth and an assumption for more moderate wage increases. Putting those together, we expect our client funds interest revenue to increase from $813 million in fiscal '23 to a range of $955 million to $975 million in fiscal '24.
Meanwhile, we expect the net impact from our client fund strategy to increase from $730 million in fiscal '23 to a range of $815 to $835 million in fiscal '24. For our ES margin, we expect an increase of 130 to 150 basis points driven by operating leverage and contribution from client funds interest revenue, offset by continued investments across our strategic priorities.
Moving on to the PEO segment. We expect PEO revenue and PO revenue excluding 0 margin pass-through to grow 3% to 5% in fiscal '24. The primary driver for our PEO revenue growth is our outlook for average worksite employee growth of 3% to 4%. This represents a gradual reacceleration from the 3% growth we're stepping off of in Q4. Strong bookings performance has already contributed to accelerating client growth, but that has so far been offset by slowing pays per control growth.
With continued strong bookings growth, our worksite employee growth should gradually reaccelerate as well. And as Maria shared, demand has been healthy, and we remain confident in the long-term growth opportunity in PEO. We expect PEO margin to be down between 20 and 40 basis points in fiscal '24 due to anticipated higher selling expenses as well as year-over-year headwind from a lower workers' compensation reserve release benefit than we experienced in fiscal '23.
Adding it all up, our consolidated revenue outlook is for 6% to 7% growth in fiscal '24. And our adjusted EBIT margin outlook is for expansion of 60 to 80 basis points. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '24 to be around 23%. And we expect adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 12%, supported by buybacks. One quick note on cadence. At this point, we expect total revenue growth to be relatively consistent quarter-to-quarter, but we expect our adjusted EBIT margin to be down slightly in Q1 on a year-over-year basis and then build over the course of the year.
Thank you, and I'll now turn it back to the operator for Q&A.

Question and Answer Session

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.

Owen Robert Callahan

This is Owen on for Ramsey. I appreciate you taking our question today. I was just curious more on kind of your PEO revenue guidance. I know you called out worksite employee growth weighing on growth there. But you expect double-digit kind of bookings growth and projects only 3% to 5% growth in PEO revenues for fiscal '24. I was just curious if you can provide any more color on that spread, is it's any conservatism or if there are any other factors to consider there?

Don Edward McGuire

Owen, thanks. Yes, I'll answer the question. We had a very, very strong sales bookings result in Q4. So we're very happy with that, and we've seen the sales reaccelerate. I think as we said in the prepared comments, we are seeing continued growth in clients. I think if there's a challenge that we're facing a little bit is we're seeing a little bit softer pays per control growth in the PEO than we would have expected. But back to what we've been saying for some time, we think the underlying value proposition is very, very strong, and we look to that business continue to grow for us and be a big part of our portfolio.

Operator

Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies.

Samad Saleem Samana

Congrats on the strong end to the fiscal year. Maybe first question, Maria, I thought it was very interesting about the announcement of moving the Roll into new international markets. How should we think about maybe what the opportunity there looks like? How much different is the complexity around payroll processing in international markets versus the U.S.? And have you included that in the bookings forecast for fiscal '24?

Maria Black

Yes. Fair enough. Thanks, Samad. And I appreciate the congratulations on the quarter and the year. We're obviously pretty proud over here. So with respect to Roll, it is exciting. It's been an exciting product for us to roll out, no pun intended across the down market here in the U.S. We're excited to take it into international. As mentioned, the initial goal is to put it into 2 countries, and it is an incremental add for us because it's really initially into these 2 countries. We're thinking more kind of the down-market SMB space, which is an area of opportunity for us across many of the markets that we serve. But we're also excited about role long term beyond that space. And so excited to dip it into our international space as we have continued the overall rollout of Roll.
In terms of factoring it into the overall bookings, not really. I think the -- by the time the launch happens and as we're thinking about the full year for our international business or full year for new business bookings, I'd be surprised if it ultimately makes a dent. But to us, it's really about the long-term value that, that offer will bring as we seek to expand the addressable market for us into these various places.
Last but not least, Samad, you mentioned the complexity of being international. And I have to tell you, I spoke to it a little bit in the prepared remarks. There's a lot that goes into being in each one of these countries. To your point, there's complexity country by country. Many countries put many of the states that are complex, here in the U.S. to [shame] in terms of the complexity that provides. And that's everything from government entities, legal tax attorneys, who is the tax authority and how do you get to them. We often think of it as an ecosystem. We think about it as kind of that final mile, if you will, and that's the complexity, and that's what we've been building over the last couple of decades in our international business.
So it's a lot more than dropping off software at a country border and hoping that it works. There's a lot to be said for the ecosystem around it, again, whether it's tax authorities, state lodgements, things of that nature. So excited to take advantage of the footprint we've built and put in our products into that footprint as we expand Roll internationally.

Samad Saleem Samana

Very helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up for Don. I know you gave -- you called out that broad base strength that drove the bookings upside and you cited several specific factors. I guess it would be helpful if you could maybe help us dimensionalize where the upside was relative to the company's own expectations at maybe the start of fiscal '23? And what you're carrying forward from what you saw in the fourth quarter into the FY '24 bookings outlook?

Don Edward McGuire

Yes, Samad, thanks for the question. I'll start here, and I think I'll turn it over to Maria for the bookings. But we certainly saw a strength across the board. I think once again, in the prepared remarks, we called out the -- our tax business and our international business. So they were very strong amongst all the ones that were strong and the down market was also quite strong. So it was really a contribution from across the board in the fourth quarter.
We talked for some time about how the pipelines are healthy and whatnot, and you've had questions before about times to get signatures on deals, et cetera. Things came together in the fourth quarter, and we were very, very pleased with the final result.

Maria Black

That's right. I -- my only add to that comment would be, we stepped into the quarter with healthy pipelines with a strong staffing position that was growing tenure. I have to tell you, when I reflect on all the quarters that I've watched across our sales execution, generally speaking, you have a bunch of businesses that are outperforming and you have a few businesses that are perhaps being carried by those that are outperforming. What I have to tell you is this was a broad-based strength across the entire organization sales implementation service, with kind of an all hands on deck execution, and that's really what it's all about. What I would attribute it to is incredible execution.

Operator

Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen.

Bryan C. Bergin

I wanted to follow up on U.S. bookings here. So you cited several areas of strength, mid-market, compliance and international. On the mid-market specifically, can you talk about what's driving that better-than-expected performance? Do you think that's driving improved competitive performance versus kind of rising tide environment? And then just I heard you comment on Next Gen HCM contributing more in the current fiscal year to bookings. Maybe talk about the initiatives and the product development that you think is going to drive that?

Maria Black

Bryan, so I'll comment on both. The mid-market strength that we've seen and it coming in a bit better than expected. It's been solid for quite some time. That's inclusive of our HRO offerings, and as you know, we've been speaking to those quite a bit in terms of the resonance of that value proposition in the market. So I think that adds to the overall strength that we have in the mid-market, which is the various flavors and offers that we have.
I think the other is that we've made tremendous investments into that business. So we do have our Next Generation Payroll engine that the sales force is pretty excited about and we're seeing that the wins that are coming in and just kind of the momentum there. I think the other is the amount of product investment and innovation that we've done in the mid-market, specifically referencing the investments we've made into the Workforce Now platform with the new UX and many of the things that I've been speaking to.
And I think the other call out is it definitely helps on a new business bookings perspective, when the business on the other side, so service and NPS, if you will, as well as retention are firing on all cylinders. And that's exactly the case. We have record retention in our mid-market, and we have near-record NPS results across the mid-market. So really, really proud of the execution in that entire space. And that definitely fuels and feeds the ability for our sellers to get excited about everything that I just mentioned to go to market.
Stepping into the question around Next Gen HCM, I did make a reference to that. We've talked a lot over the last quarters about this year. And what we've been working on is scaling implementation, and that's exactly what we've done in that business. So we were able to onboard a lot of the clients that we had on our backlog. We've shortened the time of implementation, and we also saw additions to that backlog.
So we saw new sales in the fourth quarter of that Next Generation HCM platform. We're really excited about the momentum as we step into '24. And as such, we believe that Next Gen HCM will be a larger contributor to bookings for us in the upcoming year than it was in '23, but we were pleased with what we saw in the fourth quarter and the momentum heading in.

Bryan C. Bergin

Okay. Understood. And then just on pricing, can you comment on where that ended up in fiscal '23 and what you're assuming in ES growth from a pricing standpoint in fiscal '24?

Don Edward McGuire

Yes. So we were happy with our price increase and retention. So as we've talked to many times, we want to make sure that we're not getting greedy. So we did get about 150-basis points of price in the year. And we did that without the expense of seeing a decline in retention or NPS scores. And quite frankly, those NPS scores have stayed healthy despite the price increase. So as much as price increases can land well, they have landed well, and we're very happy with how that transpired throughout '23.
For '24, we do expect to have price increases again. We do not think that we're going to be in the 150 basis point range. We're certainly going to be above our historical average of about 50 basis points. But once again, we'll watch closely and make sure that the underlying value proposition for our clients stays in place, and we'll take some price for sure, but not to the extent that we did in FY '23.

Operator

Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.

Tien-Tsin Huang

With the great bookings here, I'm just thinking around the conversion. You mentioned implementation cycles. I'm just curious if you've seen any change from clients and their desire to implement. And then similarly, just maybe based on your comments there on Next Gen HCM, I'd love to hear a little bit more around the appetite from your prospects to upgrade now at this point in the cycle. What's the pitch here given some of the macro uncertainty?

Maria Black

So I think both of your questions, I just want to confirm, I'm hearing them the right way. I think they both kind of speak to the general sentiment around the demand environment. Is that kind of a good way to think about it?

Tien-Tsin Huang

Yes.

Maria Black

In terms of decisions getting delayed and/or what's the appetite to, I suppose, by HCM in the current macro environment. And so I'll comment on the general demand environment and feel free to follow-up with an additional question if I didn't cover what you wanted. But the way that I think about demand, and I've spoken to it quite a bit over the last couple of quarters. Demand remains strong, and that is very broad-based across the business. And so if you think about the down market, you still have the strength of small business formations. You have the strength of hiring that's happening in the down market. And as such you have clients there needing to make decisions around our HCM offers in that space, right?
So that's definitely a place that we've been winning, and we'll continue to lean in as warranted by the demand. The mid-market, as we talked about that a little bit earlier in terms of the overall demand there for the complexity that exists in that market. That's inclusive again of the solution we have around our HR outsourcing offerings. And so that's kind of the mid-market.
So getting to your question, which is really about the enterprise space and perhaps even the MNC space, it is an area that we continue to watch as it relates to demand cycles, decision delays. And the main reason is those are really the places that you -- as you're aware, have additional, perhaps signers, additional levels of approval, things of that nature. And what I would say, which is consistent with what we've been seeing, is that we are back to pre-pandemic levels. So deal cycles did shorten during the pandemic, and they elongated back the pre-pandemic. But it isn't something that we're seeing additional elongation beyond historical averages.
And so to your point, though, it is an area that we consistently watch both in the enterprise space as well as in our international business, just to kind of see if the demand cycle is at the client's appetite to make buying decisions or implementation decisions during this time has changed thus far. We're not seeing it in a broad-based way. But it is an area that we continue to monitor.

Tien-Tsin Huang

Okay. No, that's great. You answered it better than I asked the question. Just on the -- as a quick follow-up, just I heard a lot about the sales and the go-to-market investments that makes sense. Just how about R&D growth here in the upcoming year versus fiscal '23? How might growth be different? And also, how might the composition be different in terms of where you're placing your bets on R&D. That's all I had.

Don Edward McGuire

Yes. I think we have a number of projects that we've shared with you all over the past number of quarters. Those projects are well underway. We won't spend a lot of time talking about specific Gen AI product -- projects, but I guess that would be a place that would anticipate, I'll get a question -- we'll get a question for that later on in this call, given it's so topical.
But generally, we're continuing our direction with the investments that we've described over the past number of quarters, and we continue to make good progress. We continue to have good delivery. The ability to take role to markets in Europe is an example of that, how investments in that development and that technology has increased. And by the way, that's part of our broader strategy that we've touched on many times, is to take some of these developments and make sure that they're global in nature as opposed to only local in nature. So nothing incredibly new, just a continuation of the great work and the great projects we have underway.

Operator

Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird.

Mark Steven Marcon

Let me add my congratulations, particularly on the strong new bookings. Maria, you went through your 3 key strategic initiatives and all the subsections, of the various initiatives, which ones are going to be the most impactful do you think from a near-term perspective? And then one specific question. Within the mid-market, you mentioned not only deploying Next Gen payroll, but you also talked about the time engine. And I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that.

Maria Black

Sure. And thank you, Mark. I appreciate the congratulations. So I am very excited about the strategic priorities as I outlined during the prepared remarks. I don't know that I was necessarily expecting to have to pick a favorite pillar or a -- one that I expect to yield impact faster than another because I think broadly speaking, they apply across all of ADP, and they will depend a bit as it relates to kind of each business, right? 
And so when I think about some of the product investments that we're making, some of the things, the work that we've done and the impact, whether it's taking a product like Roll internationally, which I mentioned earlier, won't be in a short-term results, but some of the impact of continuing to build on the momentum we have in the mid-market with our Next Generation Payroll engine, as an example, where we have an ability to win differently, we see competitive advantages and differentiation there. I think that's an area that can have tremendous impact in short order.
I think the other is, Don did it first, which is he mentioned the likes of generative AI. And when I think about that, the Gen AI and applying it broadly across these pillars, I think there is opportunity for us in product that's pretty tremendous, whether it's solving real opportunities for our clients to become more efficient. We've talked a lot about that, whether that's things like job descriptions, performance reviews, things of that nature.
But it also leads me kind of to that second pillar to your point around what will come short term versus long term. I think there's opportunity in the short term that will make impact as well as the long term in terms of really applying generative AI across our expertise that we provide to our clients. And so when I think about our ability to make it easier for our clients to engage with us or our associates to engage with our clients, some of the tools that we have already deployed across various businesses and will further deploy into fiscal '24, such as -- think of it almost as a copilot agent assist where we're helping our agents be more efficient. That's going to yield short-term results if nothing else in client satisfaction. And again, we know happy clients lead to a longer staying clients that leads to more sales and the wheel if you will.
So I think there are opportunities across all of the strategic priorities to have some impact us sooner than the long term. But yes, I'm equally excited about all of them. And certainly, we spoke quite a bit about the global piece.
In terms of the next generation time engine, that is being developed in tandem with our Next Generation Payroll engine. And those 2 things are really about time and payroll sitting together in our mid-market. It is a based on the same backbone of technology.
And so we're very excited to take that more broadly across the mid-market as we continue to take the Next Generation Payroll engine also more broadly crossed. And I think both of those things will get feathered into the impact of our win rates, if you will, and our new business bookings in the mid-market throughout the course of '24.

Mark Steven Marcon

And then, Don, you mentioned the margin expectations for the full year. And you mentioned that in the first quarter, it's probably going to be a little bit lower and then feather up over the course of the year. How much lower during the first quarter? And what's the driver there? And then how should we think about the pacing of the improvement quarter-to-quarter?

Don Edward McGuire

Yes, Mark, thanks for the question. The -- we're not looking at a big change in the first quarter, but just a couple of the drivers. Just to be clear. One, we do have some incremental investment in cost and headcount, et cetera. But the other big driver in the first quarter is it's a big borrowing quarter for us in our laddered client fund interest strategy. So that's going to put a little bit of pressure on the margin for the fourth -- sorry, for the first quarter. And the margin will continue to build over the course of the year, and we will get the overall improvement that we expected, but more out of the 3 quarters as opposed to the first.

Operator

Our next question comes from Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson.

Eugene M. Simuni

I want to come back to the PEO for a second. So great to hear about strong PEO bookings in the fourth quarter and going into the new year. Can you provide a bit more color on what helped generate this reacceleration in bookings? I know you talked in the past, Maria, about some of the actions you guys have taken to generate PEO sales. I would love to hear what caused the acceleration in bookings? And are those initiatives that those kind of levers you're pulling now completely pulled or is it still work in progress and will continue into FY '24?

Maria Black

Sure, Eugene. PEO bookings, again, we're incredibly pleased with the results in the fourth quarter and the reacceleration. We also did see the reacceleration in the third quarter. So the back half of the PEO was exactly as you suggested. It was a lot of focus for the management team, and I'm really excited about how we came together to execute. And in terms of the overall demand trends in long term, short term, I remain bullish on the overall value proposition of the PEO and the demand that it warrants. It's hard in that business to kind of pin down the demand trends because there are so many variables. And in the PEO, it's not as simple as looking at just leads and number of request for proposals that are coming in, because as you know, not every client as a potential fits.
So it's a little difficult to pin down kind of the various demand trends in the specificity outside of the overall belief in the demand environment. And there's normal level of kind of variability as it relates to PEO bookings quarter-to-quarter, which also makes it hard to kind of spot various trends. Some of that has to do with the calendar year-end, some of that has to do with when renewals happen. But nonetheless, there was a tremendous amount of focus and still remains. We remain very focused as a team across all of the leadership to make sure that we continue to drive the strong growth in bookings in the PEO in '24.

Eugene M. Simuni

Got it. Okay. And then for my follow-up, probably for Don. You talked about margin costs a little bit. So you expect another year of robust margin improvement next year, but obviously, you're not going to have as much tailwind in revenue growth as you had this year. And if you kind of do some of the (inaudible) math, it looks like your adjusted OpEx will need to grow slower next year than it did this year for you to hit your goal. So just hoping maybe you can talk a little bit what are the areas of spend where you will temper next year or maybe pull back, especially if macro conditions are not as good as kind of we expect them to be.

Don Edward McGuire

Yes. So thanks for the question. Let me start by what won't change. So what won't change is that we'll continue to make sure that we invest in key areas of the business to make sure that we can run it effectively and with the strong bookings, we'll make sure that we have the people on the ground for implementation to get those deals up and running and generating revenue for us, et cetera.
But in the last year, we did have pretty substantial growth in -- over the last couple of years coming out of the pandemic, I can't believe we're still talking about the pandemic but as we came up with that, we did have substantial growth in expenses, in service, implementation, sales, et cetera. And while we do continue to expect to see some growth, we're not going to see as much growth in expenses in those areas.
So that would be one of the areas that is going to make sure and you hit on that with respect to OpEx, we're not going to see the growth in OpEx expense that we saw in the prior year.
The other contributor, of course, that will continue to contribute, I think the yield curve is more favorable than it was the last time I spoke to you all. We will get contribution from client fund interest next year. But at the same time, it's not going to be to the extent that we did in '23. So that's also going to help with driving margins higher. But once again, not the same tailwind -- tailwinds that we had in '23. I think those are the main items that are going to help us improve our margins going into next year.

Our next question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research.

Scott Darren Wurtzel

Maybe, Don, first on the cadence of revenue growth. I know you said it should be relatively stable throughout the year, but wondering if you can maybe sort of parse that out between ES and PEO if there's any differences we should think about there?

Don Edward McGuire

Yes. So I think revenue growth is going to be -- revenue growth is going to be pretty consistent throughout the year as we start that big backlog that we now have as a result of that very, very strong fourth quarter bookings result. So we will see consistency there. Likewise with PEO, it's going to be a bit of a slower burn as we did have strong sales in Q4. So we did also talk about slightly lower pays per control growth in the PEO business. So -- but I don't think they're really going to be that different. I think they're going to be pretty close if you think about the overall growth and when you consolidate the results for the company, not substantially different between the business units.

Danyal Hussain

Yes, Scott, there is a slightly different cadence for the 2, it's not a huge difference. For PEO, we do expect an acceleration over the course of the year. So the contribution we get from our bookings and from the improvements in retention, we're expecting gradually overcoming slowing pays per control that should lead to an accelerating PEO revenue growth.
And on ES, we're expecting some deceleration assuming pays per control decelerate and assuming the contribution from client funds interest starts to fade gradually over the course of the year. So you end up with 2 different-looking ramps, but they offset and that's what nets us to a very stable revenue growth overall.

Scott Darren Wurtzel

Got it. That's very helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up on the Gen AI topic, going back to it. Obviously, there's a lot to sort of be excited about there. But just kind of wondering the magnitude of investment needed there, is that investment essentially all incremental to your investment plans for the year? Or have you had to maybe put some other projects on the back burner to focus a little more on Gen AI?

Maria Black

Yes and yes. And so said differently, the good news is we just went through our strategic plan process in the last 6 months. And so we had all of our priority sequence in all of our investments and incremental investments lined up. As we marry that to Gen AI, we have a very clear lens on where some projects may get enhanced, and where some projects may look different and perhaps get replaced by a new way of thinking about it. 
And so candidly speaking, we're going through a lot of these opportunities at this juncture kind of thinking through the bets and there will be incremental investment, and there will be other investments that we repurposed to go do some of these things in a new way. So the answer is both.

Operator

Our next question comes from Peter Christiansen with Citi.

Peter Corwin Christiansen

I'll also add to the congratulations ratio. Nice trends. Maria, a question on the international scaling effort here. I was just wondering if you -- in this context, if you could put some parameters on expected investment spend, I guess, over the next 1 to 2 years? And do you see M&A as an important contributor to the growth algorithm there?

Maria Black

Sure. You started with a question on international. So is the rest of your question about international? Or is it just in general?

Peter Corwin Christiansen

Yes, international.

Maria Black

About international. Yes. So we have been, over the years, been making in-country decisions on investments. I talked a lot about the, call it, the feet on the street, the final mile of infrastructure that we have to support our international business. And so we will continue to do that. That's inclusive of each year. We go into new markets and some of those are organic ways that we go into new markets. Some of those are actually partners that we ultimately end up at some point, call it, purchasing, if you will, or acquiring. And so the answer is both organic and inorganic. That's kind of how we've built the business over the last 20 years. And we will continue where warranted to think about it both ways. And the decision criteria for us is really about speed.
A lot of times, it's our clients that pulled us into incremental markets. When I think about the 5 markets that we went into this year or the 2 countries that we're heading into with global view, they're byproduct of clients that are choosing to pay employees in certain markets. And as such, for us, a lot of times the decision we make on how to get there, has a lot to do with speed. And as such, again, we will leverage both organic and inorganic ways to get there. So I don't know -- Don, you ran our international business for a very long time, I don't know if you want to add anything.

Don Edward McGuire

Yes, maybe just to add, I think what we've been doing, Peter, over the last number of years is we have done a number of acquisitions. They've been mostly tuck-ins, but we did have 3 interesting ones over the last year. We acquired an Italian company that has a good budget -- payroll budgeting software tool that's very prominent in the Italian market. We acquired our (inaudible) partner in South Africa, and we also bought a very exciting mid-market time-and-attendance product called SecureX in out of Bangalore and India. So -- and that product is available in India, most of Southeast Asia and the Middle East. 
So I think that's a demonstration of what we've been doing, we've been looking at and focused on to continue to make sure we grow that footprint, and we do think it continues to be an exciting space for us.

Peter Corwin Christiansen

That's great color. And Don, just as a follow-up, last slide on the maturation schedule of client fund investments, super helpful. But as we think about intra-year investment turnover, should that correlate with the seasonal balance levels that we typically see?

Don Edward McGuire

Yes. So I think as those investments mature, you're going to see those investments reinvested at higher rates, and we do expect to see our average return go up over the course of the year. The current reinvestment schedules, overnights are reinvesting at 5%. The extended in the loan portfolios are being reinvested at about 4%. We don't expect to see a huge change in the mix although the average duration of our investments has shortened a little bit over the last couple of years, but you can pretty much look at those yields, look at the maturity schedule that we provided and then look at the composition of our portfolio across the overnight, the extended and the long and pretty much come to a conclusion or come to some numbers on where you think we're going to end up.

Peter Corwin Christiansen

Just one quick one. How should we think about the duration strategy, I guess, for the next couple of quarters here, now that the Fed is perhaps kind of like stabilized, but are -- is there an effort to extend duration shortened? Just any sense there would be helpful.

Don Edward McGuire

Yes. We've had this question a few times, and the answer is we've been very successful with the strategy that we've had for the last 20 years. We certainly see that there is an opportunity cost not ever having everything in short today. At the same time, we do believe that the yield curve will normalize and the strategy we've had in place will come back and be beneficial to us over the longer term. So you shouldn't expect any significant change in our investment strategy.

Operator

Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.

James Eugene Faucette

I wanted to go back quickly on retention. I know you've touched on it a little bit. Last year, your initial outlook called for around 50 -- minus 50 to minus 25 basis points of retention degradation. But that obviously didn't really play out. And this year, you're starting with a more conservative kind of minus 70 to minus 50. But I'm hoping you could speak to how much conservatism is embedded there? And what are the drivers that you're seeing as a reason to be a little bit more conservative to start than maybe you were last year even?

Maria Black

Yes, fair -- it's a fair observation, James. Appreciate it. I think the we thought about -- by the way, I wish I knew the answer, right? So the question you're asking, which is how much conservatism is in there? And that's all to say and you hit the nail on the head, we stepped into this year guiding minus 25 to 50, we're stepping into fiscal '24 with a guide of minus 50 to 70, and we hope -- I'll end -- or I'll start with, we're very happy with where things are. We're firing on all cylinders. We have many businesses that have record NS results, record retention results, and everything is good.
And so as we step into the year, the way that we are modeling what you would see in pays per control. The way we're thinking about the potential macroeconomic tempering, if you will, specifically in the back half, is really a byproduct of how we see retention.
Part of what we saw in the fourth quarter that led to the incredible results that we had was that the normalization that we've been seeing in the down market. We did actually see the down market bounce a little bit. So even while it was down year-on-year, it came in stronger than we expected. And so we do anticipate that we may need to give some of that back, which is why we believe it was prudent to align our retention targets to our medium-term targets that we gave back in the Investor Day of 2021.
So I wish I knew the answer to your question in terms of how much conservatism, why we are guiding to what we're guiding is really about the economic outlook, whether that's GDP, unemployment is still at record lows. We haven't seen unemployment rates that low since the 60s. And so our guess is as good as yours at some level, but we did build in some tempering of the economy in the back half, and that's really what's yielding that guide on the retention.

James Eugene Faucette

I appreciate that color, Maria. That's really helpful and makes a lot of sense. I want to turn quickly also to M&A. You mentioned it in the prepared remarks, also, I mentioned it as part of at least some of your strategic initiatives. What are you seeing in terms of overall valuation levels? And what kind of things would you be targeting in terms of geography or product capabilities?

Don Edward McGuire

Yes, James. So in terms of what we're targeting, what we're talking about, there's always things kicking around, of course, but we want to make sure that anything that we do acquire either fits well in the core and gives us additional capability, or it's something that really exceeds some functionality capability that we currently have, so that we're not stacking on more and more product on top of what we already have.
The other area, of course, is to make sure that we do things that our natural adjacencies are very strong adjacencies to what we already do so that they fit well. And then thirdly, of course, is making sure that we can sell these things and run these things in a recurring model. So that we can sell them the way we sell everything else we sell today and operate them and expect to get revenue anticipation and good model from what we buy.
So I think those are the things we think about. I think we're hearing a lot around valuations coming down in the press, certainly a little bit of a dearth of activity, if you will, in the M&A space these days. But we do have lots of conversations about acquisitions and whatnot. I still think, of course, everybody is looking to get a premium what they have. And we're trying to make sure that if we're going to buy something, we're paying the right price. But we don't actually get to the point of many of these conversations given the conditions that I stated at the front at the outset to actually have a view on overall valuations in the market.
We likely get to talking about valuation in a very, very few number of cases. Remembering, of course, very, very few of the opportunities we get even get to that conversation. So I don't think I can say we have a general view. But we are focused on what we would have to pay and how things would fit into ADP.

Operator

Our last question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.

Kartik Mehta

Maria and Don, you've obviously talked a lot about the PEO and seems that the demand has really picked up. But I'm wondering, are you seeing any of your customers may be taking a little bit of a breather now pointing to sign up for the PEO because of the uncertainty in the economy and that being maybe more expensive product?

Maria Black

The PEO has a tremendous value proposition. I think we always refer to ADP as an all-weather company. I would say the most durable of our all-weather businesses is the PEO. And a lot of that has to do with the ability to flex that value proposition in a downturn pretty quickly. So if you think about clients that are growing, they enjoy the PEO because it's a quick go-to-market.
On the downside, if you will, as clients are potentially trying to work through economic headwinds. The PEO serves as a place that has a clear return on investment, has a total cost of ownership that's very again, very clear. And so I think it's a business that not to suggest that it's not impacted by a downturn, but it's a business that kind of works in both. What I would say is our sales force, we're able to pivot that narrative and that value proposition as warranted. I don't believe that has happened.
So to answer the question, our clients at this point, hesitant to purchase something such as the PEO that's so comprehensive because of the macroeconomic challenges. And my view would be no. I think that's substantiated by the record results that we had in the PEO bookings in the quarter. We also saw that strength in bookings in the third quarter. So I think that value proposition is holding firm. And I think it's a business that should -- should the economic wins ever come to life that we've been expecting for so long. It's a business that can pivot pretty quickly and the demand for the offer remains.

Kartik Mehta

And then just a follow-up. Don, you talked about obviously pays per control and retention, and maybe retention moderating as the year goes through. For pays per control, would you anticipate that just to get to flat by the end of the year? Or are you anticipating that, that could potentially go negative, and that's how you've built the guidance?

Don Edward McGuire

No. We're certainly not anticipating this as go negative. We do, though, think it's going to go to somewhere the neighborhood 1% to 2%, which is a little bit less than our historical average. However, I just want to make sure that everybody understands, we're exiting the year pretty healthily. So we figure we're off to a pretty good start, but we do expect that we're going to see a bit of a decline over the next 3, 4 quarters. And once again, we're aligning ourselves to the best we can with unemployment forecasts and et cetera.

Danyal Hussain

Kartik, if you're asking specifically about where we're exiting fiscal '24, then the pays per control is effectively decelerating from this kind of 3% range to something flatter.

Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Maria Black for closing remarks.

Maria Black

Thank you, and thank you, everyone, for joining today. As you've heard, Don and I, the entire leadership team, we're incredibly pleased with fiscal '23, specifically the fourth quarter and the finish.
So I'll kind of end where I started, which is I want to take the opportunity to once again thank the associates that create this performance. It's an unbelievable magical thing to watch it all come together and deliver what we just delivered. And so my gratitude and I celebrate each and every one of them. I also want to thank all of the stakeholders, including all of you who listen today, appreciate the support. We're certainly excited for fiscal '24. So cheers to that.

An In-Depth Analysis,"With a daily gain of 6.1% and an Earnings Per Share (EPS) (EPS) of $7.83, Automatic Data Processing Inc (NASDAQ:ADP) presents an intriguing investment opportunity. This article aims to answer a crucial question: Is ADP's stock fairly valued? To unravel this, we delve into an in-depth valuation analysis. Read on to discover more about this intriguing financial journey.

A Brief Overview of Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP)

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with ADP. Click here to check it out.  ADP 30-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of ADP

Founded in 1949, Automatic Data Processing Inc is a reputable provider of payroll and human capital management solutions. Catering to a broad spectrum of businesses, from micro to global enterprises, ADP primarily serves over 1 million clients in the United States. The company's employer services segment offers a range of services, including payroll, human capital management (HCM) solutions, human resources outsourcing, insurance, and retirement services. Its smaller, yet faster-growing professional employer organization segment provides HR outsourcing solutions to small and midsize businesses through a co-employment model.

As of July 26, 2023, ADP's stock price stands at $255.15, slightly above its fair value (GF Value) of $253.52. This comparison between the stock price and the GF Value forms the basis for a deeper exploration of the company's value. Is Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Stock Fairly Valued? An In-Depth Analysis

Understanding the GF Value

The GF Value is a proprietary measure of a stock's intrinsic value, calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor derived from the company's past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides an indication of the stock's ideal fair trading value.

If a stock's price significantly exceeds the GF Value Line, it is considered overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if the stock's price is considerably below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.

Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) stock appears to be fairly valued based on the GuruFocus Value calculation. With a market cap of $105.4 billion at the current price of $255.15 per share, the stock's long-term return is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.

Evaluating Financial Strength

Investing in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's crucial to review a company's financial strength before buying its shares. Automatic Data Processing's cash-to-debt ratio is 0.55, ranking lower than 60.7% of companies in the Business Services industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks ADP's financial strength as 6 out of 10, indicating a fair balance sheet. Is Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Stock Fairly Valued? An In-Depth Analysis

Profitability and Growth

Companies that consistently display profitability over the long term offer less risk for investors. Higher profit margins often herald a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. Over the past ten years, Automatic Data Processing has remained profitable. In the past twelve months, the company generated a revenue of $17 billion and an EPS of $7.83. Its operating margin is 21.2%, ranking better than 86.71% of companies in the Business Services industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks ADP's profitability as 9 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.

Growth is a crucial factor in a company's valuation. If a company's business is growing, it usually creates value for its shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. Conversely, if a company's revenue and earnings are declining, the value of the company will decrease. ADP's 3-year average revenue growth rate is better than 60.1% of companies in the Business Services industry. However, its 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 8.9%, ranking lower than 51.14% of companies in the same industry.

ROIC vs WACC

A useful method of determining a company's profitability is comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, ADP's ROIC is 4.95, and its cost of capital is 8.52.

At Mondelēz International, we believe our ESG agenda helps to drive growth, create value and make our business more resilient. It is why we have made sustainability the fourth pillar of our long-term business strategy, Vision 2030, alongside growth, execution, and culture.

As a global snacking leader, our ambition is to make snacking right in a world facing many different challenges, including climate change, nature-loss, worker welfare, and plastic waste, among others. To take on these challenges and deliver our sustainable growth ambition, we focus on the issues that are important to us, our consumers, and the world. This intensified and accelerated focus is at the heart of how we intend to achieve our sustainability vision of creating a future where together people and the planet thrive - by leading where we matter most and driving change where the world needs it most.

Building on our 2025 public goals, we have bold and targeted long-term ambitions that help us focus, accelerate, and scale our efforts. It is our way of turning the volume up on our aim to lead the future of snacking and make the most of our potential to have a bigger positive impact as we continue to grow.

In particular, we are focused on more sustainably-sourced cocoa and wheat, two core ingredients at the heart of our much-loved snacks. Over the first 10 years as a company, we have scaled our signature programs, Cocoa Life and Harmony wheat, helping hundreds of thousands of farmers to build stronger farming businesses and more resilient communities and landscapes. We see reduced or near zero deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life farms in West Africa and we've pioneered innovative financial incentives to help farmers restore forests. Harmony has cultivated biodiversity, specifically millions of bees and butterflies, alongside its wheat fields for many years long before it was on-trend. Looking ahead, we're proud of the recent announcements we've made to further invest in our expanded 2030 ambition for Cocoa Life and Harmony wheat.

We are also putting a longer-term focus on working toward net zero carbon and reducing packaging waste by supporting a circular packaging economy. We're capturing the carbon reductions Cocoa Life and Harmony provide as part of our net zero roadmap. On packaging, we moved to an innovative soft plastic using 30% recycled plastic in our Cadbury Dairy Milk wrappers in Australia and the UK.

While we are driving change in our own business, we know the challenges are systemic and cannot be solved by any one company alone. Multi-stakeholder coalitions are critical to achieve the systems transformation that is needed. We are actively leading key coalitions and sharing our data and learnings to develop new solutions in collaboration with peer companies.

We are also very aware of the criticality of good governance underpinning our ESG work, including the need for transparent disclosures and reporting. As the requirements in this area continue to evolve, we continue to enhance our systems and processes.

I hope you find the progress and learnings from this year's Snacking Made Right report informative and inspiring. Above all else, what I am most proud of is the passion and perseverance of my Mondelēz International colleagues around the world who have worked tirelessly to deliver these strong results. Together, we are creating a world where people and the planet thrive.

2023-07-31T16:59:35+00:00,20 Countries That Produce the Most Sugar,"In this article, we will discuss countries with the highest yield of sugar and their latest sugar production quantity. If you want to skip our analysis of the global sugar market and its impact on the economies of the world's biggest sugar producers, read 8 Countries That Produce The Most Sugar.

Brazil, India, and China lead the countries that produce the most sugar; these nations collectively make up 41% of the global production. If we talk about Brazil, its hold in the sugar industry is powered by expansive sugarcane fields and a favorable climate. However, a substantial portion of Brazil's sugarcane harvest is diverted to ethanol production due to government mandates and global biofuel demand. On the other end of the supply chain, the United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Cuba, and Malaysia are the Countries With The Highest Sugar Consumption.

The white, refined sugar we see comes from either sugar cane or sugar beet, the two sugar crops whose growth determines a country's ability to produce processed sugar. Sugarcane is native to tropical regions in South Asia and is the world's largest crop in production, with over 1.966 billion tons produced in the previous crop year. Once cut, the cane stalks are crushed to extract the juice, which is then purified and crystallized to produce raw sugar.

Intriguingly, sugar beet is a root crop that many don't presume is a source of sugar, but it very much is. Of the 20 countries that produce the most sugar, four heavily rely on sugar beet, namely the United States, Russia, Ukraine, and France, as the crop primarily grows in the cooler climates of the Northern Hemisphere.

Sugarcane is also the most consumed crop in the world, as its global consumption reached 1.966 billion tons in the crop year 2021/2022. Explore 15 Most Consumed Crops in the World to learn more about the most significant crops.

According to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global sugar market is $46.4 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $59.1 billion by 2028. The market will grow at a CAGR of 5% between 2023 and 2028, owing to increasing demand for processed food and beverages.

Story continues

The food and beverage industry is a significant consumer of raw sugar and affects market trends to a great extent. According to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), American youth consumes 143 calories from SSBs (sugar-sweetened beverages) daily, while the consumption is 145 calories for older people. If we talk about average sugar consumption (including beverages, refined sugar, etc.), American adults take 17 teaspoons of added sugar every day, which is 2-3 times higher than the recommended amount as per the American Heart Association.

While refined sugar's raw calories are associated with obesity and other health issues, it's imperative for the beverage and processed food industry. For instance, the Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are two titans of the beverage industry. The global market presence, along with a massive demand for sugar to produce their flagship carbonated drinks, means the purchasing decisions of Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) can significantly impact global sugar prices.

The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) offers over 500 brands in more than 200 countries and territories. As a major producer of sugar-sweetened beverages, the company's sugar procurement strategy and demand heavily influence global sugar prices and market trends. Likewise, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has multiple well-known brands like Pepsi, Mountain Dew, and Gatorade, among many others. So naturally, the company is one of the largest purchasers of sugar in the world.

Apart from the beverage industry, the confectionery industry also heavily relies on raw sugar. Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), the owner company of brands like Cadbury and Oreo, is a big stakeholder in the market. Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) reported net revenues of $31.496 billion in 2022, 9.6% higher than a year before. It's the well-loved brands like Milka, Trident, and Cadbury that drive Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) 's high sugar use.

The biofuel industry, specifically ethanol production, is another off-taker of raw sugar. Brazil, the world's largest sugar producer, channels a substantial portion of its sugarcane crop into ethanol production. As a result, companies like Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) are stakeholders in the sugar market. The rising demand for biofuels could stimulate increased sugar production and potentially higher prices.

Let's now list the top countries in sugar industry. 20 Countries That Produce the Most Sugar

20 Countries That Produce the Most Sugar

Our Methodology

We ranked the top 20 sugar producing countries according to their raw sugar yield in the crop year 2020/2021. Our source for this study was the Food and Agriculture Organization Of The United Nations (UN FAO). After shortlisting the nations leading in sugar production, we downloaded their raw sugar output stats from the UN FAO database by selecting the indicators of 'production quantity in 2020', as these are the latest records available.

Based on our findings, here are the 20 countries that produce the most sugar:

20. Ukraine

Annual Raw Sugar Production: 1.17 million metric tons

Ukraine is a top player in the global sugar market, and beet sugar is the main type produced. The country was estimated to produce approximately 1.17 million metric tons of sugar in the 2020/2021 crop year. A large part of Ukraine's agricultural sector is devoted to sugar beet cultivation because of its fertile soil conditions and favorable climate. Major regions for sugar beet cultivation include Poltava, Vinnytsia, and Khmelnytskyi.

19. Iran

Annual Raw Sugar Production: 1.56 million metric tons

Iran's sugar production primarily revolves around two crops: sugar beets and sugarcane. In 2020/21 crop year, the country produced over 1.56 million tonnes of sugar annually. Sugar beets are grown in the country's colder north, while sugarcane thrives in the hot and humid southern region. Sadly, Iran has been grappling with a water shortage that impacts sugar production.

18. Argentina

Annual Raw Sugar Production: 1.80 million metric tons

Argentina is renowned for its fertile Pampas grassland and has a long history of harvesting sugarcane. As a result, it sits amongst countries that produce the most sugar, with annual production exceeding 1.8 million tonnes. The subtropical provinces of Tucumán, Salta, and Jujuy are Argentina's main sugarcane cultivation areas, as they benefit from adequate rainfall and warmth. The Argentine sugar industry is heavily mechanized, focusing on producing bioethanol from sugarcane as an alternative energy source.

17. South Africa

Annual Raw Sugar Production: 2.10 million metric tons

South Africa's sugar industry is predominantly based in KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga provinces. The country ranks amongst 20 countries that produce the most sugar, owing to its around 24,000 registered sugarcane growers. South Africa cultivates about 19-20 million tonnes of sugarcane annually, then processed in 14 mills nationwide. Sugar production provides employment opportunities and facilitates infrastructural development.

16. Indonesia

Annual Raw Sugar Production: 2.123 million metric tons

Indonesia is one of the countries that produce the most sugar. It is also the fifth-largest sugar consumer in Asia; the country's sugar industry is centered in Java, where the climate favors sugarcane cultivation. However, regardless of its vast cultivation areas, Indonesia's sugar production is often insufficient to meet its domestic demand as there are inefficiencies in farming and processing.

15. Philippines

Annual Raw Sugar Production: 2.125 million metric tons

In the Philippines, sugar production is a vital industry supporting over five million people directly or indirectly. The country produces an average of 2.12 million metric tons of sugar annually, catering mostly to domestic consumption. The Philippines' sugar industry also significantly contributes to bioethanol production, as the Biofuels Act of 2006 mandates a minimum bioethanol blend in gasoline.

14. Colombia

Annual Raw Sugar Production: 2.21 million metric tons

Colombia produces approximately 2.2 million tons of sugar per year, and sugarcane is a significant cash crop. Much of this output is used for domestic consumption, while a sizable portion is converted into ethanol for biofuel.

13. Guatemala

Annual Raw Sugar Production: 2.65 million metric tons

Guatemala is one of the world's top sugar exporters, producing around 2.65 million tons of sugar annually. It's worth noting that the sector is heavily invested in modern technologies for irrigation, production, and energy co-generation from sugar cane waste.

12. Turkey

Annual Raw Sugar Production: 2.79 million metric tons

Turkey's sugar production is heavily based on sugar beet and has seen a shift due to governmental agricultural policies. Traditionally, state-run sugar factories dominated the industry, but liberalization since 2018 has allowed private enterprises to contribute significantly to the production. Turkey produced around 2.79 million tons of sugar during the last crop year, but its dependence on sugar imports to meet its domestic consumption needs signifies a production-demand gap.

11. Egypt

Annual Raw Sugar Production: 2.9 million metric tons

Egypt is among the top sugar-producing nations in Africa, as its annual production reaches almost 3 million tons. The sugar industry in Egypt has taken strides toward modernization and has invested significantly in upgrading machinery and refining processes. The government has also been working to ensure self-sufficiency and reduce dependence on imported sugar.

10. France

Annual Raw Sugar Production: 3.8 million metric tons

France is one of the biggest sugar producers in Europe, particularly of sugar beets, as they are well-suited to its temperate climate. The country's annual sugar production is 3.8 million tons, owing to its sugar beet yield. France has high-yielding sugar beet varieties, and its efficient, modern sugar refineries make the most of this crop. France's sugar industry also takes a sustainable approach as many producers use beet pulp and molasses, byproducts of sugar production, to make biofuels and animal feed.

9. Australia

Annual Raw Sugar Production: 4.33 million metric tons

Australia's Queensland and New South Wales areas boast a thriving sugar industry centered around sugar cane production. The nation produced over 4.33 million tons of raw sugar in 2020/2021 and became one of the largest sugar producing countries. Most Australian sugar farms are often located in coastal areas and make use of the tropical climate that is necessary for sugar cane growth.

Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Gilead Sciences, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Gilead Sciences, Inc. Quote

Factors to Note

Revenues in the second quarter have most likely been boosted by increased sales in oncology and HIV franchises, as in the first quarter. However, a decline in Veklury (remdesivir) sales is likely to have dented this growth slightly.

Sales in the HIV franchise are being driven by higher demand for the flagship HIV therapies Biktarvy and Descovy. Biktarvy’s sales increased 24% year over year in the previous quarter due to higher demand and the trend is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.

Descovy’s revenues are being boosted by higher demand and favorable pricing dynamics and the momentum is likely to have continued in the second quarter.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Biktarvy and Descovy is pegged at $2.8 billion and $491 million, respectively. Our model estimates for the same are $2.7 billion and $497 million, respectively.

The Liver Disease portfolio sales, including chronic hepatitis C virus (“HCV”), chronic hepatitis B virus (“HBV”) and chronic hepatitis delta virus (“HDV”), increased in the previous quarter, driven by higher demand and timing of purchases in the United States. The trend has most likely continued in the second quarter.

Sales of Veklury are likely to have seen a decline.

Cell Therapy product sales are likely to have soared in the second quarter. Yescarta sales are primarily being driven by increased demand for relapsed or refractory (“R/R”) large B-cell lymphoma (“LBCL”) in the United States and Europe. Tecartus (brexucabtagene autoleucel) sales are being driven by increased demand in adult R/R B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”) and mantle cell lymphoma (“MCL”) in the United States and Europe. Sales are likely to have experienced a sequential increase, driven by the label expansions of Yescarta and Tecartus.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cell Therapy product sales is $476 million and our estimate for the same is $489.2 million.

Increased sales of Trodelvy, reflecting continued uptake in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, have also likely boosted sales in the second quarter.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Trodelvy sales is $242 million and our estimate for the same is $235 million.

Operating expenses are also likely to have increased in the second quarter.

Pipeline & Regulatory Updates

Apart from the regular top- and bottom-line numbers, we expect investors to focus on key pipeline updates when the company reports.

The European Commission (EC) approved Trodelvy  as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who have received endocrine-based therapy and at least two additional systemic therapies in the advanced setting. Approval in additional geographies will boost sales of the drug.

2023-07-28T12:00:55+00:00,Here's Why We Think Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) Might Deserve Your Attention Today,"It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.

If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Gilead Sciences with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.

Check out our latest analysis for Gilead Sciences

How Fast Is Gilead Sciences Growing?

If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Gilead Sciences managed to grow EPS by 4.5% per year, over three years. This may not be setting the world alight, but it does show that EPS is on the upwards trend.

Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. While Gilead Sciences' EBIT margins are down, it's not all bad news as revenues are at least stable. While some people may not be too phased, this could be a sticking point for some investors.

In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image. earnings-and-revenue-history

While we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Gilead Sciences?

Are Gilead Sciences Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?

Since Gilead Sciences has a market capitalisation of US$95b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Holding US$50m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same.

Does Gilead Sciences Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?

One important encouraging feature of Gilead Sciences is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. Don't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified  3 warning signs for Gilead Sciences that you should be aware of.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

IonQ (IONQ) A concept image of a processor representing quantum computing. IONQ Stock

IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) is one of the best quantum computing stocks for investors. The company’s technology allows its computers to perform longer, more complex calculations with fewer errors than any quantum computer yet built. That makes IonQ a speculative investment with significant growth potential.

There’s a good reason to feel bullish on IONQ. The company recently entered into a significant partnership with QuantumBasel, Switzerland’s first quantum hub. The collaboration aims to establish a European quantum data center and includes the installation of two advanced IonQ quantum computers at QuantumBasel. The partnership is reportedly backed with over $500 million in private funding. That may help put IonQ on the map and give it a leg up over competitors.

For momentum investors, there’s good reason to consider this stock too. It’s up 418% year to date. Its EPS is also forecasted to grow 20% over the next five years.

Analog Devices (ADI) In Ultra Modern Electronic Manufacturing Factory Design Engineer in Sterile Coverall Holds Microchip with Gloves and Examines it.. Semiconductor stocks

Source: Shutterstock

Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) is a leading semiconductor company whose processing chips are vital to today’s digital economy. As quantum computing grows, related suppliers like semiconductors are expected to become increasingly important.

Story continues

As a mid-cap ($99.49 billion) stock, Analog Devices offers great growth potential. The brand beat revenue and earnings estimates last quarter. Sales grew 10% year-over-year, while earnings surged 18%. Sales were $3.26 billion, and adjusted earnings were $2.83 per share.

Wall Street gave ADI stock a $207.83 price target. I think this target is feasible. The market has resumed its risk appetite for tech stocks, and speculative plays like ADI stock have come back into fashion. Its share also trades just below its 52-week high, and judging by its momentum indicators, it will breach this resistance zone shortly.

Rigetti Computing (RGTI) An image of a computer chip on a motherboard; quantum computing

Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ:RGTI) is a full-stack quantum computing company that designs quantum chips, integrates those chips with a controlling architecture and develops software. This quantum computing stock should definitely be on your radar.

Rigetti’s competitive advantage lies in its focus on hybrid quantum-classical computing systems. In short, it wants to give consumers the best of both worlds. It aims to accomplish this through the release of its Ankaa-1 84-qubit system. Once it has built significant traction with its release, it will attempt to capture a quantum advantage over its competitors.

The company also recently entered into a collaboration agreement with ADIA Lab, an independent research institute based in Abu Dhabi specializing in data and computational sciences. The partnership aims to design, build, execute and optimize a quantum computing solution.

Take, for example, the Zacks Computer & Technology sector, which is up 41% in 2023 compared to the S&P 500’s impressive 21% gain. Zacks Investment Research

And for those interested in further exposure to the sector, three stocks – StoneCo STNE, Analog Devices ADI, and nVent Electric NVT – would all provide precisely that.

All three are forecasted to witness solid earnings growth, have seen their earnings outlooks improve over the last several months, and carry sound valuations. Let’s take a closer look at each.

StoneCo

StoneCo offers an end-to-end cloud-based technology platform to conduct electronic commerce across in-store, online, and mobile channels. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with earnings expectations drifting higher.

As shown below, the revisions trend has been robust across multiple timeframes. Zacks Investment Research

In addition, the company’s valuation is attractive, with the current 18.9X forward earnings multiple sitting nowhere near the steep 45.5X five-year median and highs of 66.9X in 2022. The stock carries a Style Score of “B” for Value. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

And it’s impossible to ignore the company’s growth expectations, with earnings forecasted to soar 115% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 20% in FY24. Top-line growth is also apparent, with sales suggested to climb 4.4% and 8% in FY23 and FY24, respectively.

Analog Devices

Analog Devices, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices. The revisions trend has been notably bullish for its current fiscal year, with the $10.57 per share estimate up nearly 7% since July 2022. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Shares aren’t stretched regarding valuation, with the current 18.1X forward earnings multiple well beneath the 21.1X five-year median and steep highs of 23.5X in 2022. The stock sports a Style Score of “C” for Value. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

The company has been a consistent earnings performer, exceeding both earnings and revenue estimates in 12 consecutive quarters. ADI posted a 3% EPS beat in its latest release and reported revenue nearly 2% ahead of expectations.

nVent Electric

nVent Electric, a current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), provides electrical connection and protection solutions. Analysts have been bullish across all timeframes over the last several months. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

NVT shares provide exposure to technology paired with a passive income stream; NVT’s annual dividend currently yields 1.3%, with a payout ratio sitting sustainably at 27% of the company’s earnings. The payout hasn’t grown in the last five years, but NVT’s 125% share gain during the period certainly picks up the slack.

Keep an eye out for the company’s upcoming quarterly release expected on July 28th; the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.68 indicates a solid 20% improvement in earnings from the year-ago quarter. In addition, nVent Electric is expected to post $787 in quarterly revenue, 8% higher year-over-year. Zacks Investment Research

Bottom Line

With the strong performance of technology stocks in 2023, investors have been scurrying to find exposure if they didn’t already have it.

And for those interested in riding the sector’s current momentum, all three stocks above – StoneCo STNE, Analog Devices ADI, and nVent Electric NVT – would be worth a close look.

All three sport solid growth, an improved earnings outlook, and sound valuations.

2023-07-31T13:58:00+00:00,"Drug, Biotech Stocks' Q2 Earnings Due on Aug 1: PFE, MRK &amp; More","The second-quarter 2023 reporting cycle of the Medical sector is about to pick up pace this week. The sector mainly comprises pharma/biotech and medical device companies.

The earnings season for the Medical sector kicked off around mid-July when bellwether Johnson & Johnson reported better-than-expected second-quarter results. It beat estimates for earnings as well as sales. All three segments, Pharmaceutical, MedTech and Consumer Health, delivered a strong performance in the quarter, gaining from solid demand trends. Among the biotechs, Biogen and GSK plc reported their second-quarter results last week, where both companies beat earnings and revenues estimates. Biogen maintained its previously issued financial outlook for 2023, while GSK raised the same.

The Earnings Trends report indicates that as of Jul 26, 17.2% of the companies in the Medical sector — representing 35.2% of the sector’s market capitalization — reported quarterly earnings. Of these, 90% have outperformed on both earnings and revenues. Earnings increased 3.1% year over year, while revenues increased 12.8%. Overall, second-quarter earnings of the Medical sector are expected to decline 31.2%, while sales are expected to rise 3.3% from the year-ago quarter.

Pfizer PFE, Merck MRK, Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX, Exelixis EXEL and Incyte INCY are scheduled to release second-quarter earnings on Aug 1. While, PFE, MRK and INCY are set to report before the opening bell, VRTX and EXEL will report after market close.

Let’s see how these biotech/pharma companies might have performed in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.

Pfizer

Pfizer has an impeccable earnings track record. PFE’s earnings beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 17.84%. In the last reported quarter, Pfizer’s earnings beat estimates by 23%.

Per our proven model, companies with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) have a good chance of delivering an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

For the quarter to be reported, Pfizer has an Earnings ESP of -2.11% and a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s adjusted EPS is pegged at 57 cents per share. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Pfizer’s revenues are expected to have declined in the second quarter of 2023 due to steep expected declines in revenues of its COVID-19 products on lower demand.

Merck

Merck has an encouraging earnings track record. It beat earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters, delivering an average earnings surprise of 7.77%. In the last reported quarter, MRK beat earnings estimates by 4.48%.

For the quarter to be reported, Merck has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings is pegged at $2.17 per share.

Strong global underlying demand across its business, particularly for cancer drug Keytruda and HPV vaccine, Gardasil, is likely to have boosted sales growth in the second quarter as in the previous quarters.

Exelixis beat earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters, missing the mark on one occasion, delivering an average earnings surprise of 10.89%. In the last reported quarter, EXEL reported a negative earnings surprise of 30.43%.

For the quarter to be reported, Exelixis has an Earnings ESP of -21.94% and a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings is pegged at 22 cents per share.

Exelixis’ second-quarter revenues are likely to have been fueled by higher sales of its key drug, Cabometyx (cabozantinib), most likely due to higher sales volume and price.

Incyte beat earnings estimates in two of the last four quarters but missed the mark on the other two occasions, delivering an average negative earnings surprise of 10.05%. In the last reported quarter, INCY delivered a negative earnings surprise of 56.47%.

For the quarter to be reported, Incyte has an Earnings ESP of -2.20% and a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 87 cents.

An increase in sales of Jakafi, a first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor in all approved indications (polycythemia vera, myelofibrosis and refractory acute graft-versus-host disease), is likely to have boosted revenues in the second quarter. While Incyte markets Jakafi in the United States, Novartis promotes the same drug as Jakavi outside the country. INCY is expected to have received higher royalties from Novartis in the second quarter on higher Jakavi sales.

2023-07-28T21:14:36+00:00,3 Biotech Stocks to Buy Before the Breakout,"During this Q3 of 2023, there have been many changes to U.S. healthcare at different levels. At the state level, there were changes to gender-affirming care. At the national level, the FDA has approved over-the-counter birth control pills and considered aspartame to be a carcinogen. The user count of telemedicine services continues to increase, and technological advancements in drug-making have led to the clinically testing a drug created by Artificial Intelligence in Hong Kong.

These developments are strong on their own, but couple impressively with the continual rise of biotech. Two critical examples in 2023 include the USDA approving food made with cell-grown meats and the FDA approving Krystal’s (NASDAQ:KRYS) skin disorder gene therapy. The industry is expected to grow to $3.2 trillion by 2030 at a 12.8% CAGR.

The combination brings ample room for growth that investors can capitalize upon. Here are three biotech stocks that demonstrate this high growth potential for the remainder of 2023.

Bio-Techne Corporation (NASDAQ:TECH) is a leading developer, researcher, and seller of purified proteins and reagent solutions, or substances used to drive chemical reactions. Unlike other biotech companies, Bio-Techne is a conglomerate of eleven brands with each providing a unique product and service. Not only does this business model allow it to enter various markets and appeal to several consumer audiences, but it is also inherently safer in the long run. If one brand fails, ten more brands keep the corporation afloat.

TECH stock is up 6.52% YTD. Its latest quarter’s earnings displayed a solid performance with its revenue of $294.15 million seeing 1.3% YoY growth. Its diluted EPS of $0.43 grew 16.22% YoY. Earnings aside, this positive trend carried through to many other metrics, including net income of $70.22 million representing a 15.61% YoY growth. The stock has net profit margin of 23.87% seeing 14.1% YoY growth.

Story continues

Given that the biotech industry has a CAGR of 17.83% and scientific advancements are propelling such growth each day, Bio-Techne recognizes that it must continue to enact catalysts in order to stay relevant in its competitive market. Thus, management has devised a three-year plan designed to get its revenue to $2 billion by fiscal year 2026. This strategy, nicknamed “The Path to $2B,” involves releasing a string of new, innovative products over the next few years. If executed correctly, the company forecasts having around a 50% CAGR by FY26, in comparison to its current 7%.

Accordingly, Yahoo Finance analysts see the value Bio-Techne holds for future growth, with six out of nine labeling it as either a “Buy” or “Strong Buy.” Moreover, the average analyst target price is $100.99. Given TECH stock’s current actual price is $86.20, many feel it is undervalued.

Ultimately, Bio-Techne has positioned itself excellently for a bright future, as part of an industry that commends fresh, innovative merchandise.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) Various medical equipment is on top of a page with information about cystic fibrosis.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) is a heavyweight in cystic fibrosis (CF) medication, providing treatments to the majority of CF patients in Australia, Europe, and North America. Alongside stable conditions in the CF market, the company’s continued research and development provide a promising pipeline for the foreseeable future.

The CF market has continued to provide stable yields with revenue and EPS exceeding expectations. Operating expenses were high this quarter, mainly due to research and development of the new treatments. However, this is not an issue as the company still has more than $11 billion in cash and investments paired with a strong cash flow and balance sheet. Since these developments are expected to achieve large payoffs, this is a worthy investment.

With so much left to discover about biotechnology, the global market isprojected to grow at a 13.96% CAGR from 2023 to 2030. Currently working on multiple new treatments, Vertex is poised to take advantage of this growth. Its exa-cel gene therapy for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia is approaching market approval with the FDA promising review by December 8th. The therapy is expected to reach a total of 32,000 patients.

VX-548 for acute pain and VX-147 for APOL1-Mediated Kidney Disease have both reached clinical trial phase 3 with great revenue potential. VX-548 is in a field with few major innovations, so management sees this opioid alternative for acute pain as a multibillion-dollar opportunity.

Yahoo Finance reported 22 of 27 analysts rated Vertex as a “buy” with a mean 1-year price target of $377.04. Vertex is currently very stable and profitable, and its constant pursuit of new technologies leaves the company in an excellent position for growth.

2023-07-31T11:00:17+00:00,Are Robust Financials Driving The Recent Rally In Lam Research Corporation's (NASDAQ:LRCX) Stock?,"Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 38% over the last three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Lam Research's  ROE in this article.

Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.

View our latest analysis for Lam Research

How Is ROE Calculated?

The formula for return on equity is:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Lam Research is:

55% = US$4.5b ÷ US$8.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).

The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.55 in profit.

Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?

We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.

Lam Research's Earnings Growth And 55% ROE

To begin with, Lam Research has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 16% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This likely paved the way for the modest 19% net income growth seen by Lam Research over the past five years.

Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Lam Research's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 31% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see. past-earnings-growth

The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Lam Research fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.

Is Lam Research Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?

Lam Research's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 19% (implying that it retains 81% of its income), which is on the lower side, so it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business.

Additionally, Lam Research has paid dividends over a period of nine years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 19% of its profits over the next three years. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 47%.

Summary

In total, we are pretty happy with Lam Research's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

2023-07-29T18:25:00+00:00,Aflibercept 8 mg Two-Year Results from Pivotal PHOTON Trial in Diabetic Macular Edema Presented at ASRS,"89% and 84% of patients were maintained on ≥12- and ≥16-week dosing intervals, respectively, throughout the two-year period, while sustaining their vision and anatomic improvements

At two years, 44% of patients met the criteria for ≥20-week dosing intervals, including 27% who were eligible for 24-week dosing intervals

TARRYTOWN, N.Y., July  29, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced the first presentation of positive two-year (96 weeks) results from the pivotal PHOTON trial investigating aflibercept 8 mg with 12- and 16-week dosing regimens, compared to EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection, in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME). The results were presented at the American Society of Retina Specialists (ASRS) annual meeting.

“At two years, the PHOTON trial demonstrates the substantial impact aflibercept 8 mg could have in reducing treatment burden for patients with diabetic macular edema,” said Diana V. Do, MD, Professor of Ophthalmology and Vice Chair for Clinical Affairs at the Byers Eye Institute, Stanford University and a trial investigator. “Maintaining two years of vision and anatomic improvements with as few as three or four injections per year, while not compromising safety, is impressive and could make a meaningful difference in the lives of the patients we treat.”

PHOTON (N=658) is a double-masked, active-controlled pivotal trial evaluating non-inferiority of aflibercept 8 mg extended dosing intervals compared to EYLEA. Patients receiving aflibercept 8 mg were initially randomized to either 12- (n=328) or 16-week (n=163) dosing intervals (after three initial monthly doses) compared to an 8-week dosing regimen for EYLEA (n=167) after five initial monthly doses. During the trial, patients receiving aflibercept 8 mg could have their dosing intervals shortened down to an every 8-week interval if protocol-defined criteria for disease progression were observed. Patients were only able to extend their dosing intervals in the second year by 4-week increments up to 24-weeks, if pre-specified criteria were met.

The PHOTON trial met its primary endpoint last year with aflibercept 8 mg patients achieving clinically equivalent vision gains to EYLEA, with approximately 90% maintaining 12- and 16-week dosing regimens through the first year. Through two years, the mean number of injections administered were 9.5 for the 12-week aflibercept 8 mg group, 7.8 for the 16-week aflibercept 8 mg group, and 13.8 for the EYLEA group, with the vast majority of aflibercept 8 mg patients maintaining extended dosing intervals as first shared in June 2023:

89% of patients maintained ≥12-week dosing intervals, compared to 93% through one year84% maintained ≥16-week dosing intervals, compared to 89% maintaining a 16-week dosing interval through one year, among those randomized at baseline to a 16-week dosing interval44% met the criteria for ≥20-week dosing intervals at week 96, including 17% and 27% who were eligible for 20- and 24-week dosing intervals, respectively

The safety of aflibercept 8 mg continued to be similar to EYLEA through two years and remained consistent with the known safety profile of EYLEA from previous clinical trials for DME. Ocular treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) occurring in 5% of patients in any treatment group, in decreasing frequency, were cataract, vitreous floaters and conjunctival hemorrhage. There were no cases of retinal vasculitis, occlusive retinitis or endophthalmitis. The rate of intraocular inflammation was 1.2% for both the EYLEA and aflibercept 8 mg groups. Anti-platelet trialists' collaboration-defined arterial thromboembolic TEAEs occurred in 7.2% of patients treated with EYLEA and 6.7% of patients treated with aflibercept 8 mg.

The full ASRS presentation is available on the Regeneron website. The two-year data from the pivotal PULSAR trial for aflibercept 8 mg in wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) are expected in the third quarter of 2023.

Aflibercept 8 mg is investigational, and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. Aflibercept 8 mg is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Bayer AG, with Regeneron sponsoring the PHOTON trial. In the U.S., Regeneron maintains exclusive rights to EYLEA and aflibercept 8 mg. Bayer has licensed the exclusive marketing rights outside of the U.S., where the companies share equally the profits from sales of EYLEA and aflibercept 8 mg following any regulatory approvals.

About the Aflibercept 8 mg Clinical Trial Program 
PULSAR in wAMD and PHOTON in DME are double-masked, active-controlled pivotal trials that are being conducted in multiple centers globally. In both trials, patients were randomized into 3 treatment groups to receive either: aflibercept 8 mg every 12 weeks, aflibercept 8 mg every 16 weeks, or EYLEA every 8 weeks. The lead sponsors of the trials were Bayer for PULSAR and Regeneron for PHOTON.

Patients treated with aflibercept 8 mg in both trials had 3 initial monthly doses, and patients treated with EYLEA received 3 initial doses in PULSAR and 5 in PHOTON. During the trial, patients in the aflibercept 8 mg groups could have their dosing intervals shortened down to an every 8-week interval if protocol-defined criteria for disease progression were observed. Intervals could not be extended until the second year of the study. Patients in all EYLEA groups maintained a fixed 8-week dosing regimen throughout their participation in the trials.

About DME
DME is a common complication in eyes of people living with diabetes. DME occurs when high levels of blood sugar lead to damaged blood vessels in the eye that leak fluid into the macula. This can lead to vision loss and, in some cases, blindness. Of the nearly 28 million American adults living with diabetes, an estimated 1.2 million have DME.

About Ophthalmology at Regeneron
At Regeneron, we relentlessly pursue groundbreaking innovations in eye care science to help maintain the eye health of the millions of Americans impacted by vision-threatening conditions. Over a decade ago, our breakthrough scientific research resulted in the development of EYLEA, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor designed to block the growth of new blood vessels and decrease the ability of fluid to pass through blood vessels in the eye. EYLEA has since brought fundamental change to the retinal disease treatment landscape and is supported by a robust body of research that includes eight pivotal Phase 3 trials, 11 years of real-world experience, and more than 64 million EYLEA injections globally.

Regeneron continues to advance our anti-angiogenesis expertise with new solutions with the aim of offering optimal flexibility for a broad group of patients and eye care professionals. This includes aflibercept 8 mg, which is being developed with the aim of extending the time between injections, while maintaining the vision gains, anatomic benefits and safety previously observed with EYLEA.

EYLEA (aflibercept) Injection 2 mg (0.05 mL) is indicated for the treatment of patients with Neovascular (Wet) Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Macular Edema following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) (0.4 mg [0.01 mL]).

CONTRAINDICATIONS

EYLEA is contraindicated in patients with ocular or periocular infections, active intraocular inflammation, or known hypersensitivity to aflibercept or to any of the excipients in EYLEA.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Intravitreal injections, including those with EYLEA, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering EYLEA. Patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately. Intraocular inflammation has been reported with the use of EYLEA.Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with EYLEA. Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with VEGF inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately.In infants with ROP, reactivation of abnormal angiogenesis and tortuosity may occur following treatment with EYLEA. Infants should be monitored closely after injection with EYLEA until retinal vascularization has completed or until the examiner is assured that reactivation of ROP will not occur. Treatment with EYLEA will necessitate extended periods of ROP monitoring and additional EYLEA injections and/or laser treatments may be necessary.There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including EYLEA. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients treated with ranibizumab; through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) in the EYLEA group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab group. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with EYLEA in the first six months of the RVO studies.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in <0.1% of intravitreal injections with EYLEA including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment.The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in patients receiving EYLEA were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased.In pre-term infants with ROP receiving EYLEA the most common adverse reactions (≥4%) reported were retinal detachment, conjunctival hemorrhage, and intraocular pressure increased. Adverse reactions established for adult indications are considered applicable to pre-term infants with ROP, though not all were observed in the clinical studies.Patients may experience temporary visual disturbances after an intravitreal injection with EYLEA and the associated eye examinations. Advise patients not to drive or use machinery until visual function has recovered sufficiently.

89% and 84% of patients were maintained on ≥12- and ≥16-week dosing intervals, respectively, throughout the two-year period, while sustaining their vision and anatomic improvements

At two years, 44% of patients met the criteria for ≥20-week dosing intervals, including 27% who were eligible for 24-week dosing intervals

TARRYTOWN, N.Y., July 29, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced the first presentation of positive two-year (96 weeks) results from the pivotal PHOTON trial investigating aflibercept 8 mg with 12- and 16-week dosing regimens, compared to EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection, in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME). The results were presented at the American Society of Retina Specialists (ASRS) annual meeting.

“At two years, the PHOTON trial demonstrates the substantial impact aflibercept 8 mg could have in reducing treatment burden for patients with diabetic macular edema,” said Diana V. Do, MD, Professor of Ophthalmology and Vice Chair for Clinical Affairs at the Byers Eye Institute, Stanford University and a trial investigator. “Maintaining two years of vision and anatomic improvements with as few as three or four injections per year, while not compromising safety, is impressive and could make a meaningful difference in the lives of the patients we treat.”

PHOTON (N=658) is a double-masked, active-controlled pivotal trial evaluating non-inferiority of aflibercept 8 mg extended dosing intervals compared to EYLEA. Patients receiving aflibercept 8 mg were initially randomized to either 12- (n=328) or 16-week (n=163) dosing intervals (after three initial monthly doses) compared to an 8-week dosing regimen for EYLEA (n=167) after five initial monthly doses. During the trial, patients receiving aflibercept 8 mg could have their dosing intervals shortened down to an every 8-week interval if protocol-defined criteria for disease progression were observed. Patients were only able to extend their dosing intervals in the second year by 4-week increments up to 24-weeks, if pre-specified criteria were met.

Story continues

The PHOTON trial met its primary endpoint last year with aflibercept 8 mg patients achieving clinically equivalent vision gains to EYLEA, with approximately 90% maintaining 12- and 16-week dosing regimens through the first year. Through two years, the mean number of injections administered were 9.5 for the 12-week aflibercept 8 mg group, 7.8 for the 16-week aflibercept 8 mg group, and 13.8 for the EYLEA group, with the vast majority of aflibercept 8 mg patients maintaining extended dosing intervals as first shared in June 2023:

89% of patients maintained ≥12-week dosing intervals, compared to 93% through one year 84% maintained ≥16-week dosing intervals, compared to 89% maintaining a 16-week dosing interval through one year, among those randomized at baseline to a 16-week dosing interval 44% met the criteria for ≥20-week dosing intervals at week 96, including 17% and 27% who were eligible for 20- and 24-week dosing intervals, respectively

The safety of aflibercept 8 mg continued to be similar to EYLEA through two years and remained consistent with the known safety profile of EYLEA from previous clinical trials for DME. Ocular treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) occurring in 5% of patients in any treatment group, in decreasing frequency, were cataract, vitreous floaters and conjunctival hemorrhage. There were no cases of retinal vasculitis, occlusive retinitis or endophthalmitis. The rate of intraocular inflammation was 1.2% for both the EYLEA and aflibercept 8 mg groups. Anti-platelet trialists' collaboration-defined arterial thromboembolic TEAEs occurred in 7.2% of patients treated with EYLEA and 6.7% of patients treated with aflibercept 8 mg.

The full ASRS presentation is available on the Regeneron website. The two-year data from the pivotal PULSAR trial for aflibercept 8 mg in wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) are expected in the third quarter of 2023.

Aflibercept 8 mg is investigational, and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. Aflibercept 8 mg is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Bayer AG, with Regeneron sponsoring the PHOTON trial. In the U.S., Regeneron maintains exclusive rights to EYLEA and aflibercept 8 mg. Bayer has licensed the exclusive marketing rights outside of the U.S., where the companies share equally the profits from sales of EYLEA and aflibercept 8 mg following any regulatory approvals.

About the Aflibercept 8 mg Clinical Trial Program 
PULSAR in wAMD and PHOTON in DME are double-masked, active-controlled pivotal trials that are being conducted in multiple centers globally. In both trials, patients were randomized into 3 treatment groups to receive either: aflibercept 8 mg every 12 weeks, aflibercept 8 mg every 16 weeks, or EYLEA every 8 weeks. The lead sponsors of the trials were Bayer for PULSAR and Regeneron for PHOTON.

Patients treated with aflibercept 8 mg in both trials had 3 initial monthly doses, and patients treated with EYLEA received 3 initial doses in PULSAR and 5 in PHOTON. During the trial, patients in the aflibercept 8 mg groups could have their dosing intervals shortened down to an every 8-week interval if protocol-defined criteria for disease progression were observed. Intervals could not be extended until the second year of the study. Patients in all EYLEA groups maintained a fixed 8-week dosing regimen throughout their participation in the trials.

About DME
DME is a common complication in eyes of people living with diabetes. DME occurs when high levels of blood sugar lead to damaged blood vessels in the eye that leak fluid into the macula. This can lead to vision loss and, in some cases, blindness. Of the nearly 28 million American adults living with diabetes, an estimated 1.2 million have DME.

About Ophthalmology at Regeneron
At Regeneron, we relentlessly pursue groundbreaking innovations in eye care science to help maintain the eye health of the millions of Americans impacted by vision-threatening conditions. Over a decade ago, our breakthrough scientific research resulted in the development of EYLEA, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor designed to block the growth of new blood vessels and decrease the ability of fluid to pass through blood vessels in the eye. EYLEA has since brought fundamental change to the retinal disease treatment landscape and is supported by a robust body of research that includes eight pivotal Phase 3 trials, 11 years of real-world experience, and more than 64 million EYLEA injections globally.

Regeneron continues to advance our anti-angiogenesis expertise with new solutions with the aim of offering optimal flexibility for a broad group of patients and eye care professionals. This includes aflibercept 8 mg, which is being developed with the aim of extending the time between injections, while maintaining the vision gains, anatomic benefits and safety previously observed with EYLEA.

IMPORTANT EYLEA SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATIONS

INDICATIONS
EYLEA (aflibercept) Injection 2 mg (0.05 mL) is indicated for the treatment of patients with Neovascular (Wet) Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Macular Edema following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) (0.4 mg [0.01 mL]).

CONTRAINDICATIONS

EYLEA is contraindicated in patients with ocular or periocular infections, active intraocular inflammation, or known hypersensitivity to aflibercept or to any of the excipients in EYLEA.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Intravitreal injections, including those with EYLEA, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering EYLEA. Patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately. Intraocular inflammation has been reported with the use of EYLEA. Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with EYLEA. Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with VEGF inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately. In infants with ROP, reactivation of abnormal angiogenesis and tortuosity may occur following treatment with EYLEA. Infants should be monitored closely after injection with EYLEA until retinal vascularization has completed or until the examiner is assured that reactivation of ROP will not occur. Treatment with EYLEA will necessitate extended periods of ROP monitoring and additional EYLEA injections and/or laser treatments may be necessary. There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including EYLEA. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients treated with ranibizumab; through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) in the EYLEA group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab group. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with EYLEA in the first six months of the RVO studies.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in <0.1% of intravitreal injections with EYLEA including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment. The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in patients receiving EYLEA were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased. In pre-term infants with ROP receiving EYLEA the most common adverse reactions (≥4%) reported were retinal detachment, conjunctival hemorrhage, and intraocular pressure increased. Adverse reactions established for adult indications are considered applicable to pre-term infants with ROP, though not all were observed in the clinical studies. Patients may experience temporary visual disturbances after an intravitreal injection with EYLEA and the associated eye examinations. Advise patients not to drive or use machinery until visual function has recovered sufficiently.

Factors at Play

A major chunk of Regeneron’s revenues come from the sales of its lead drug, Eylea, which is approved for various ophthalmology indications (neovascular age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema and macular edema, among others). Eylea was developed in collaboration with Bayer AG.

Regeneron records net product sales of Eylea in the United States, while Bayer records net product sales of the drug outside the country. Regeneron also records its share of profits/losses in connection with sales of Eylea outside the United States.

However, Eylea sales have been under pressure in the last couple of quarters due to competition from Avastin and sale deductions. The second quarter is likely to have seen the same trend. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Eylea’s sales in the United States is pegged at $1.53 billion.

Apart from Eylea, investors will focus on the asthma drug Dupixent’s performance, sales of which are recorded by Sanofi SNY. Regeneron has a collaboration agreement with Sanofi for drugs like Dupixent and Kevzara. While Sanofi records sales, Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with global sales of Dupixent and Kevzara. Profits from Dupixent sales have been REGN’s primary growth driver in the last few quarters.

Sales of Dupixent were up 34.2% in the second quarter, as recorded by Sanofi and hence Regeneron is likely to have recorded incremental profits in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.

Story continues

Dupixent has maintained its stellar performance, driven by continued strong demand in the approved indications, atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis. The label expansion of the drug in the past few months has boosted sales further and is likely to have resulted in incremental revenues for Regeneron in the second quarter.

Investors will focus on the performance of Libtayo and the PCSK9 inhibitor Praluent. Effective Jul 1, 2022, Regeneron records net product sales of Libtayo and pays Sanofi a royalty on such sales. Increased sales of Libtayo on-label expansions have most likely boosted the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Libtayo’s sales is pegged at $191 million.

Regeneron records net product sales of Praluent in the United States. Sanofi records net product sales of the drug outside the United States and pays Regeneron a royalty on such sales. Total sales in the previous quarter witnessed a 31% increase and sales in the second quarter are likely to have maintained the momentum.

In January 2022, the FDA revised the authorizations for a few monoclonal antibody treatments, including Regeneron’s REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab), as data indicated that these treatments are highly unlikely to be active against the Omicron variant. REGEN-COV is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies (casirivimab and imdevimab, also known as REGN10933 and REGN10987, respectively). Therefore, REGEN-COV is currently unauthorized for use in U.S. states, territories or jurisdictions. Hence, this revision has dented sales thereafter.

Regeneron and Roche share gross profits from global sales of REGEN-COV and Ronapreve based on a pre-specified formula.

RECENT UPDATES

The FDA issued a complete response letter (CRL) to the company’s biologics license application seeking approval for the 8 mg dose strength of aflibercept for the treatment of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD), diabetic macular edema (DME) and diabetic retinopathy (DR).

Regeneron has reported that the cause of the CRL is only an ongoing review of inspection findings at a third-party filler. The company reaffirmed that the CRL was not levied due to issues with the clinical efficacy or safety, trial design and labeling or drug substance manufacturing of aflibercept 8 mg. Furthermore, the company also stated that the FDA had not requested any additional clinical data or studies for the drug candidate.

Additional updates on the same are expected on the call.

2023-07-28T18:39:47+00:00,Billionaire Jeff Vinik’s Stock Picks and 10-Year Performance,"In this piece, we will take a look at billionaire Jeff Vinik's stock picks and 10-year performance. If you want to skip our introduction to the investor, his background, and how some investments have performed over the year, then head on over to Billionaire Jeff Vinik's Top 5 Stocks.

Jeff Vinik has a short history in the hedge fund industry. He set up his fund first in the 90s and then shut it down later after making remarkable returns. Then, he tried setting up his fund again but shut it down in less than a year after citing difficulties in raising capital. A graduate of Harvard University, he is known primarily for running one of the biggest mutual funds in the U.S. and then starting his own hedge fund called Vinik Asset Management.

Both of these earned him his fair share of fame in the finance industry. Under Mr. Vinik's management, the Fidelity Magellan Fund earned quite a bit of controversy as he was criticized for moving the fund's money away from attractive technology stocks into bonds. This was the time when semiconductor stocks (which are all the buzz these days) were in their early phases of their stock market presence. This was also the time when investing in mutual funds - especially by folks who were using their personal savings  - was peaking, as 3 million Americans had piled $3 trillion into the industry.

At Magellan, Mr. Vinik created quite a bit of controversy when it came to light that he had sold large portions of the fund's holdings in semiconductor stocks at a time when the shares were peaking. The semiconductor sector is well known for its cycles of ups and downs, with the latest one undergoing right now as chip makers wait while chip designers' product inventory is digested in the retail chain. Back in the early 1990s, Taiwan and South Korea were rising in stature in the chip world (these two now have some of the most important chip companies in the world). The start of the decade was marked by a strong performance from the Asian firms, but America, which was still a global chip manufacturing base back then, was struggling from an economic contraction in the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, high inflation, and high interest rates (the economy is also experiencing somewhat similar conditions over the past year or so).

Story continues

This crunch created the perfect conditions for a boom in 1995 and the subsequent slowdown which was also reflected in the stock market. Just as all this was happening, Mr. Vinik had written to investors of the Magellan Fund that chip firms, such as Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) were solid investments. This was in a letter that was mailed in November as part of the fund's semiannual report. However, controversy surfaced when the Washington Post reported that Mr. Vinik had actually started selling Micron shares in October and before investors received the letter. This selloff was part of a broader exit from the technology sector with other stocks also being sold. Less than a year after his decision, he would quit Magellan and set up his own hedge fund, with some speculating that the increased scrutiny from 1995 contributed to him leaving Fidelity.

Vinik Asset Management would go on to make a big impact in the hedge fund industry right off the bat. In the first year, the hedge fund's return would sit at a whopping 93.8% and then go on to an average of 48% for five years. After this burst of performance, Mr. Vinik would return $4.2 billion to investors and close the fund to outside investment in 2000. He would, however, try to open up his hedge fund twice again, first in 2005 and then in 2019. The first run would be quite successful as Vinik Asset Management would go on to operate for nearly eight years before a downturn in gold stocks and other factors would make it return capital. The second run was short lived, with Mr. Vinik explaining that it had become difficult to raise capital.

So, today we'll take a look at how his long term investments would have performed ten years after Vinik Asset's final serious foray into the stock market. Some firms that would have performed well are eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR).

2023-07-31T19:38:36+00:00,Bad News Will Actually Be a Boost for These 3 Troubled Tech Stocks,"While we’ve all heard the phrase bad news is good news in the capital markets, for certain tech stocks rising from adversity, the adage may yield considerable shareholder profits. As a caveat, one should realize that companies that print red ink often do so for a reason. Usually, it’s not a good one. Still, high-return troubled tech stocks continue to delight fortunate speculators.

One reason why tech stocks turning negative into positive remains a legitimate phenomenon for some organizations comes down to a simple mathematical reality: the market never generates perfectly linear trajectories. If it does, it doesn’t last for long. It’s like baseball – slumping players often hit a home run because they’re due.

Another reason to consider tech stocks with high recovery potential is that they may offer brilliant discounts for those willing to see through the ugliness and look toward the potential. Typically, tech plays operate as growth-oriented endeavors. When investors get cold feet, the volatility could be severe because such enterprises lack alternative avenues, such as dividends. At the same time, when investors believe again, the upside can be equally intense. With that, below are resilient tech stocks to consider.

Tech Stocks Rising from Adversity: Twilio (TWLO) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks

Source: shutterstock.com/CC7

A specialist in programmable communication tools, Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) essentially makes several of our favorite apps operate smoothly. From ordering ride-sharing services to having food delivered to our doorstep, Twilio’s tech wizardry undergirds connectivity platforms with real substance. TWLO also makes a case for tech stocks rising from adversity.

Unfortunately, the company suffered heavily under the weight of the Federal Reserve’s hawkish monetary policy. For example, the loss of sentiment in the cryptocurrency space resulted in declined interest in Twilio’s two-factor authentication (2FA) protocol. These and many other headwinds forced multiple rounds of steep layoffs. Still, it could be one of the high-return troubled tech stocks.

Story continues

As InvestorPlace Assistant News Writer Shrey Dua mentioned, Twilio benefits from an expanded partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Specifically, the communications specialist will enhance Amazon Web Services (AWS) predictive AI proficiency.

To be fair, Twilio’s financials could use some work, particularly in sparking credibility toward a path to profits. Still, management might be making the right moves, thus warranting consideration for tech stocks turning negative into positive.

PayPal (PYPL) tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocks

Source: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.com

A popular financial technology (fintech) firm, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) specializes in online payments and business management solutions. From the spring doldrums of 2020 through most of Sept. 2021, PYPL represented a high-flying asset. Fundamentally, government restrictions on non-essential activities and broader social concerns sparked interest in contactless platforms. However, it’s now a candidate for tech stocks rising from adversity.

On a monetary policy level, rising borrowing costs from spiked interest rates didn’t exactly help a growth trade like PayPal. In addition, as fears of the SARS-CoV-2 virus faded, certain fintech platforms facilitating contactless transactions lost relevance. Combined with rising competition, PayPal started distributing pink slips. Earlier this year, management announced it would reduce its workforce by about 7%.

Nevertheless, PYPL might be one of the tech stocks with high recovery potential. In particular, the burgeoning gig economy could help lift PayPal. Indeed, the company benefits from significant brand awareness (read trust). Also, PYPL carries a moderate buy consensus view with a $91.11 price target, implying 23% upside. Thus, it’s one of the resilient tech stocks in experts’ eyes.

BuzzFeed (BZFD) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks

Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com

To be 100% clear, media firm BuzzFeed (NASDAQ:BZFD) represents one of the riskiest ideas you can ever dream up for tech stocks rising from adversity. Some might say the company deserves its troubles. Earlier this year, the platform sparked controversy when it came to light that BuzzFeed was quietly publishing entire articles generated by artificial intelligence. However, this decision might not have been the best idea.

Shortly thereafter, management announced a significant workforce reduction to the tune of 15% of its staff. Ominously, the company shut down BuzzFeed News, its straight news and investigative reporting unit. Sadly, digital ad dollar declines and a terrible market for journalism sparked the pink slips. It’s a common theme within the content-generation space, with several sector players feeling the heat.

Nevertheless, having made the cuts, it’s also possible that management can focus on what works. In other words, cut the journalism and go for titillating editorials. I’m not even sure the modern audience knows the difference.

Granted, this is a tough case for high-return troubled tech stocks. However, it’s interesting that in the trailing month, BZFD gained over 29% of equity value. Who knows – maybe there’s a chance?

The company’s robust services have enabled it to maintain a deep and trusted relationship with merchants and consumers. Its two-sided platform helps develop direct financial relationships with customers and merchants.

The Total Payment Volume (TPV) for the second quarter is anticipated to reflect the impacts of all these factors. TPV is a key growth metric for PayPal’s top line.

In the last reported quarter, TPV improved by 10% year over year on a spot rate basis and 12% on a currency-neutral basis to $354.5 billion.

For second-quarter 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for TPV is pegged at $370.02 billion, suggesting growth of 8.9% on a year-over-year basis.

Portfolio Strength: A Key Catalyst

PayPal’s continuous efforts toward strengthening the services portfolio are likely to have aided in gaining traction among various customers in the second quarter.

In the said quarter, the company strengthened its payment solution offerings for small businesses by adding new features. The features allow small businesses to accept payments made through PayPal, credit and debit cards, digital wallets, Venmo, PayPal Pay Later and Apple Pay.

PayPal introduced Tap to Pay on Android for Venmo and Zettle users to empower small businesses with seamless payment options.

This apart, the robust performance of Venmo is likely to have continued to contribute well. The company’s TPV is likely to have benefited from Venmo’s strengthening monetization efforts.

PayPal introduced the Venmo Teen Account in the second quarter in a bid to allow parents and legal guardians to open a Venmo account for their teenagers between the ages of 13 and 17. This move is expected to have driven PayPal’s momentum among teenagers.

Additionally, the company’s strengthening cryptocurrency efforts, along with the Venmo integration and the expanding global footprint of its cryptocurrency service, are expected to have contributed well.

The solid momentum in the buy now, pay later solution of PayPal is likely to have benefited the quarterly performance.

Factors to Consider

MercadoLibre’s efforts to bolster its e-commerce business by promoting branding and loyalty are expected to have driven growth in its unique buyer base in the second quarter.

Strengthening shipping services is expected to have helped the company deliver an enhanced shopping experience to its customers in the quarter to be reported. It is likely to have contributed to shipment growth via MercadoEnvios in the quarter under review.

Its growing initiatives toward strengthening the fintech business are expected to have driven the total payment volumes in the to-be-reported quarter. Strength across online payment merchant services and online wallets is anticipated to have benefited MELI in the quarter to be reported.

The company’s expanding online-to-offline offerings are likely to get reflected in the upcoming results.

MercadoLibre’s solid momentum across the marketplace and non-marketplace businesses is expected to get reflected in its second-quarter results.

Strong investments in its logistics business are expected to have favored the delivery system’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Expanding the managed logistics network is anticipated to have benefited the business’s second-quarter performance.

However, increasing warehousing costs for managed networks and expenses related to infrastructure transitions on public clouds are likely to have impacted MELI’s profitability in the quarter under review.

2023-07-28T20:24:56+00:00,3 E-Commerce Stocks that could be the Next Amazon,"Over the past two decades, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has revolutionized consumer shopping in the e-commerce space. Starting as a book retailer, it has morphed into an everything store. Given its size, the company might have limited growth ahead. But other high-potential e-commerce stocks could grow to Amazon’s size.

Overall, the e-commerce trend is in its early stages and has decades of secular growth ahead. According to Morgan Stanley, global e-commerce comprises 22% of retail sales. Thus, there is room for growth given the advantages offered in this model, notably the convenience and selection.

So, what are the best e-commerce stocks to buy? Obviously, Amazon has been the leader to date, but it’s a popular stock in market indices and investment portfolios. Moreover, with over $500 billion in annual sales, the growth rate will be lower than in earlier years.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Instead, focusing on smaller e-commerce stocks ready to explode might provide better returns. These companies mainly operate in emerging markets where e-commerce penetration is low and set to rise, bringing high-potential for the stocks and their investors.

Often referred to as the Amazon of Latin America, MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) has cemented its place as the leading online retailer in South America. It operates in 18 South and Central American countries including Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica and Mexico. Notably, it’s beating Amazon in terms of market share in markets including and similar to Brazil.

Over the past decade, Mercado’s growth has been on fire. And the Covid-19 pandemic only accelerated e-commerce adoption. In fiscal year (FY) 2019, revenues grew 59.50%. While that’s an astounding rate, growth accelerated further in 2020 and 2021, hitting 73% and 78% respectively.

Typically, investors buy e-commerce stocks like MercadoLibre due to their revenue growth. But the company differentiates itself by having exceptional revenue growth and profits. This trend continued in Q1 FY2023, where revenues grew 58.4% year-over-year (YOY) on an FX-neutral basis.

Story continues

Profits were more impressive, hitting $340 million aided by an improvement in margins to 11.2% from 6.2% in the previous year’s quarter. Management expects to improve profitability further as the business scales. Furthermore, the recent bankruptcy filing of competitor Americana has placed it in a prime position to grab more market share in Brazil

These developments have increased the bullishness in the stock. As of this writing, TipRanks analysts have a $1,536 price target representing a 30% upside. From now on, MELI is positioned for growth in the expanding e-commerce category.

Sea Limited (SE) The logo for Sea Limited is seen on a web browser through a magnifying glass.

Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) provides online retail services through its Shopee e-commerce platform. After soaring more than 700% from between Q1 in 2020 and Q3 in 2021, Sea Limited has fallen back to earth due to a strategic misstep.

In a miscalculated decision to expand into India, Latin America and Europe, the company tried to pursue too many markets while still unprofitable in its core Southeast Asia market. Unfortunately, its strategy didn’t work in Europe and Latin America. And in India, regulatory hostility led to a quick exit.

Still, Sea is one of the best high potential e-commerce stocks to buy due to its market position in Southeast Asia. After withdrawing from the Latin American market in September 2022, the firm has focused on its stronghold. Today, it has over 50% market share in the Southeast Asia region.

As Q1 FY2023 results showed, growth is still solid. The e-commerce segment revenues increased 36.3% YOY, and the firm has significantly improved profitability in the segment as a result, reporting a $207 million adjusted EBITDA profit, compared to a $742 million loss in the first quarter of 2022.

Despite the impressive numbers in e-commerce, the stock plunged 17% after earnings. Investors were spooked by the $2.0 billion of total loans receivable in its digital financial services segment, Sea Money. The decline has continued, with the stock falling from $88 before earnings to the current $61.

The decline presents an opportunity in one of the top high potential e-commerce stocks. In the earnings call, management stated that the increasing receivables and provision for credit losses were manageable. “Non-performing loans past due by more than 90 days as a percentage of our total gross loans receivable remained stable at around 2%,” stated CEO Forest Li.

At current prices, SE stock is one of the undervalued e-commerce stocks. As Shopee capitalizes on its growth initiatives including the Affiliate Program and enhanced seller tools, SE stock will rally.

PDD Holdings (PDD) A smartphone displays the Pinduoduo (PDD) website.

A Chinese e-commerce giant, PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: PDD) is growing rapidly despite the emerging weakness in the Chinese economy. It’s one of China’s leading e-commerce players with over 900 million users.

While its core China e-commerce business and Duoduo Grocery segments have been growth drivers over the past five years, it has a new growth engine in the popular shopping app Temu. The app has garnered widespread interest earning a top three in the App Store. Temu  The shopping app offers a wide selection of merchandise that’s heavily discounted. Users can enjoy discounts as high as 90% in 22 countries, including the U.S. market after a September 2022 launch.

PDD Holdings has set ambitious targets for Temu and is making significant investments. In 2023, it is targeting $3 billion in gross merchandise value. It hopes to grow GMV to $30 billion in five years.

Notably, Temu has made a unique effort in its advertising efforts. Rather than marketing on Google, Instagram or TikTok, it offers significant discounts and coupons for repeat customers as well as referral rewards. As a result, it has gained considerable momentum in the U.S. market.

In the first quarter, total revenues grew 58% YOY to $5.48 billion. And since high potential e-commerce stocks at a bargain valuation are rare, PDD stock is offering an opportunity to investors now. According to Finviz, the stock is trading at a bargain forward P/E of 16.

Given the popularity of Temu and the strength of its China business, PDD Holdings could be the next Amazon.

2023-07-29T15:34:37+00:00,10 Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 2023,"In this article, we will take a look at the 10 stocks that will make you rich in 2023. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 2023.

To make money by investing in the stock market, one ought to follow time-tested investing principles with patience. But sometimes the market creates opportunities that have the potential to reward investors who are ready to ride the bandwagon of time. Artificial intelligence is the ultimate money-making bandwagon of 2023 and perhaps several years to come. While many believe AI is quickly becoming a hype and pushing stocks’ valuation to dangerous levels, there are credible analysts who still believe tech stocks have a long way to go in this AI revolution.

The AI Gold Rush

Wedbush’s Dan Ives recently said that the AI “gold rush” would be driving tech stocks higher in the second half of 2023.

“The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th derivatives of this A.I. Gold Rush are just starting to evolve for the tech landscape. As we have covered the tech sector for decades and saw the dot.com bubble and burst firsthand, [we believe] this is the start of a 4th Industrial Revolution playing out across tech over the coming years that is still being underestimated by the Street in our opinion,” Ives said during an interview with CNBC.

Not all bubbles are bad. Some bubbles have the potential to make investors rich and give them evergreen gains and long-term opportunities. SkyBridge Capital Founder Anthony Scaramucci, while talking to BNN Bloomberg, said that while AI is “probably in a bubble,” there are still some AI stocks that should be in investors’ portfolio. Anthony Scaramucci specifically talked about Nvidia, a stock many analysts believe has become overvalued amid its latest AI-driven performance. Scaramucci said that Nvidia may be overvalued currently “but if you own it for the next 15 years, you’ll probably be OK.”

One of the biggest reasons why AI stocks have the potential to gain further is the explosive potential and applications of generative AI. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, the generative AI market could expand by about 40%, to $1.3 trillion by 2032.

The AI Bubble and How to Make the Most of It

Billionaire investor George Soros’ thoughts on bubbles are interesting and have become highly relevant in the current backdrop. Soros in 2009 famously said:

""When I see a bubble forming, I rush to buy, adding fuel to the fire.""

In a detailed lecture in 2009, Soros explained his bubble theory. Soros thinks that a boom-bust cycle is set in motion when a trend and a misconception positively reinforce each other. Positive reinforcements keep inflating the bubble through positive feedbacks. This bubble is tested by market dynamics from time to time but if the trend is strong enough, it survives this test, according to Soros. This cycle enters what Soros calls the “twilight” stage when the trend begins to lose stream but nonetheless maintains inertia before eventually beginning to decline.

At what stage the current AI boom is? No one can say for sure but an overwhelming majority of market analysts believe the AI revolution is just getting started. To make money from this revolution, analysts recommend some stocks that are expected to ride the AI wave.

10. SoftBank Group Corp. (OTC:SFTBY)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: N/A

Japanese investment giant SoftBank Group Corp. (OTC:SFTBY) has not been much impressive over the past few years.

(OTC:SFTBY)’s chief Masayoshi Son recently announced the company is ready to shift to “offense mode” and benefit from the AI revolution.

“What I am interested in most, what I am working on most, is the AI revolution. I believe that mankind is going to be exceeded by computer or AI. We would like to be [in] the leading position for the AI revolution,” Son reportedly said.

SoftBank Group Corp. (OTC:SFTBY) is preparing to publicly list British semiconductor company ARM later this year. Analysts believe the move could give Softbank a huge AI-related boost.

Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal upgraded SoftBank Group Corp. (OTC:SFTBY) shares to Buy and said:

""We expressed a view that SBG stock will rally ahead of the ARM IPO later in the year... But given (the) market's fascination for semi-stocks, we think it makes sense to move early.”

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31

Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) is going ballistic over AI and made headlines earlier this year by launching AIP, its AI platform for defense and military. Palantir Technologies Inc.

(NYSE:PLTR) has gained about 140% year to date through July 7.

Dan Ives counted Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) among the top companies he believes could gain from the AI market which he thinks could reach $800 billion over the next 10 years.

As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 31 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR).

8. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72

Some analysts believe Texas-based CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) could make investors rich in 2023 and beyond as the software company’s products are seeing huge demand. Recently, BTIG Research added CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its list of top picks for the rest of 2023. BTIG is bullish on CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) amid its dominance in the endpoint security/EDR market, high win rates against rivals like Microsoft, strong customer recognition, and successful performance in emerging product categories.

Morgan Stanley analysts recently said that AI has created a new opportunity in the cybersecurity domain. They believe AI-led automation in the industry could create $30 billion in productivity gains and much of those could go to a few companies including CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.

Artisan Developing World Fund made the following comment about CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:

“Top contributors to performance for the quarter included graphics semiconductor company Nvidia, Southeast Asian e-commerce platform Sea, Latin American marketplace MercadoLibre, online travel marketplace Airbnb, and endpoint security company CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD). CrowdStrike rebounded as its financial results eased demand-related concerns in its core endpoint business, while adoption in platform adjacencies continued to rise.”

7. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 82

Being a leader and first mover in the lucrative EV industry gives Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) an advantage that it keeps enjoying, thanks to Elon Musk’s relentless innovation and proactive approach. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has already gained about 155% year to date through July 7. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is gaining after the company posted Q2 delivery numbers. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) delivered 466,140 electric vehicles in the second quarter of 2023, surpassing estimates of 445,000 units. This was an 83% year-over-year growth.

Ives thinks Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is on track to hit 1.8 million unit delivery milestone for 2023.

""With this delivery beat, we believe the sum-of-the-parts story for Tesla is another step towards coming into play with its newly released supercharger network OEM deals, energy business, AI driven autonomous path, unmatched battery ecosystem, and increased production scale/scope globally adding to the Tesla golden EV success story,” Ives said.

Ives has a $300 price target on Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Cathie Wood of ARK, which has a $1.13 billion stake in Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), thinks Tesla shares could reach $3000 by 2025.

6. Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NYSE:PANW)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87

Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NYSE:PANW) is another stock that analysts believe can ride the AI bandwagon. Goldman Sachs recently released its “Rule of 10” screen picks which include companies that have showed strong sales growth over the past couple of years and are expected to continue posting solid revenue growth. Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NYSE:PANW) made it to the list.

Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NYSE:PANW) is uniquely positioned to benefit from the AI boom. The company launched its platform XSIAM that uses automation and AI for information and cybersecurity. Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NYSE:PANW)’s CEO has a special focus on AI and the company is expected to see more growth based on its AI products. He said during fiscal Q3 earnings call in May:

“I think there is no doubt we will continue to deploy our proprietary AI models for XSIAM or for our network security use case as I highlighted. We believe in our preliminary analysis over the last three months and driving a lot of these work streams internally that there is a dare there with generative AI. So we believe that we will be deploying generative AI over the course of the next few months, and we’ll talk more about it At a later event. But we think that has an opportunity both to significantly improve our customer efficiency and the efficacy of our products, at the same time, also to drive efficiencies within the way we run Palo Alto Networks. I think last but not the least, which is something you didn’t ask, but I’ll say, separately, Lee and his team have been working hard to see and look at the adverse impact that generative AI could have in terms of adversaries using Generative AI to build new malware, to try and attack our customers.”

TimesSquare U.S. Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:

“Within Information Technology, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) offers network security solutions to enterprises, services providers, and government entities. The company delivered another strong quarter with revenues, billings, and earnings all above the consensus. Management recognizes a challenging macro environment that is altering customer behavior such as increased deal scrutiny and elongating sales cycles. Their shares pulled back by -15% during the quarter.”

KLA also offers inspection tools and systems for optical metrology and e-beam metrology.

The GF Value is a proprietary measure of a stock's intrinsic value, calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at.

According to GuruFocus Value calculation, KLA (NASDAQ:KLAC) appears to be fairly valued. This estimation is based on the historical multiples that the stock has traded at, the past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher. Given that KLA is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth. Is KLA Corp (KLAC) Fairly Valued? An In-depth Analysis

Big Tech Rallies as Yields Slip on Hopes Fed Hikes in Rear View Mirror

Big tech including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) racked up gains as Treasury yields slipped after the closely watched Fed inflation measure slowed more than expected.

The personal consumption expenditures slowed to a 0.2% pace in June from 0.1% a month earlier, taking the annual pace to 3% for the month, markedly slower than the 3.8% in prior month.

Ford pushed out its target to reach a 600,000-unit EV production run rate to 2024 from end of of 2023 previously.

Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) rallied 31% after the streaming media device platform reported quarterly results that were expected and guidance that some on Wall Street deemed conservative.

Roku’s third-quarter guidance for adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of negative $50 million and revenue of $815 million ""appears to us to be as conservative as Q2 was,"" Wedbush said in a note.

Consumer products giant Procter&Gamble (NYSE:PG), a major dow component, reported better-than-expected second-quarter results, sending its shares nearly 3% higher.

The non-GAAP and supplemental information provided in this press release is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, KLA's financial results presented in accordance with United States GAAP.

To supplement our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we provide certain non-GAAP financial information, which is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain gains, costs and expenses, as well as other supplemental information. The non-GAAP and supplemental information is provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our operating performance and our prospects in the future. Specifically, we believe that the non-GAAP information, including non-GAAP net income attributable to KLA, non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to KLA, non-GAAP gross margin and free cash flow, provides useful measures to both management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial performance by excluding certain costs and expenses that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results to help investors compare our operating performances with our results in prior periods as well as with the performance of other companies. The non-GAAP information is among the budgeting and planning tools that management uses for future forecasting. However, because there are no standardized or generally accepted definitions for most non-GAAP financial metrics, definitions of non-GAAP financial metrics are inherently subject to significant discretion (for example, determining which costs and expenses to exclude when calculating such a metric). As a result, non-GAAP financial metrics may be defined very differently from company to company, or even from period to period within the same company, which can potentially limit the usefulness of such information to an investor. The presentation of non-GAAP and supplemental information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared and presented in accordance with United States GAAP. The following are descriptions of the adjustments made to reconcile GAAP net income attributable to KLA to non-GAAP net income attributable to KLA:

a. Acquisition-related charges primarily include amortization of intangible assets, transaction costs associated with our acquisitions and dispositions, as well as intangible asset impairment charges. b.  Restructuring, severance and other charges primarily include costs associated with employee severance including associated acceleration of recognition of certain stock-based and other compensation expenses, gains and losses from exiting non-core businesses, interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits, charges related to liquidation of legal entities and adjustments related to non-controlling interest. Restructuring, severance and other charges in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 include a gain on the sale of Orbograph, Ltd. (""Orbograph""), which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, partially offset by certain transaction bonuses triggered by the sale of Orbograph. c.  Loss on extinguishment of debt includes a pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of the $500 million 4.650% Senior Notes due in November 2024. d.  Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments includes the income tax effects of the excluded items noted above. e. Discrete tax items in all periods presented include a tax impact relating to the amortization of certain intellectual property as a result of an internal restructuring of ownership rights to align with how our business operates. Discrete tax items in the three months ended June 30, 2022 include an increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Discrete items in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 include a tax expense of $19.8 million from an internal restructuring and an adjustment of the net benefit of the Orbotech Ltd. 2012 to 2018 Israel tax audit settlement, for which the net benefit includes the liability on the audit settlement less reductions in unrecognized tax positions and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Discrete tax items in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 also include a tax impact from the sale of Orbograph.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5.09%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this cable provider would post earnings of $7.21 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.65, delivering a surprise of -7.77%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $13.6 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.

Charter shares have added about 18.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 18.2%.

What's Next for Charter?

While Charter has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Let’s take a look at three of these consumer-centric stocks that will be reproting their quarterly earnings on Tuesday, August 1.

Molson Coors (TAP)

Starting out is Molson Coors which stock currently covets a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Molson may be able to quench investors' thirst for stocks with more upside as earnings estimates are noticeably higher.

Strong quarterly growth is expected for the global beer manufacturer with popular brands including Blue Moon, Miller Life, Coors Light, and Miller Genuine Draft.

Even better, annual earnings are now projected to jump 16% this year and rise another 2% in fiscal 2024 at $4.86 per share. Earnings estimates have continued to trend higher over the last quarter and the cherry on top may be Molson’s 2.32% dividend yield in a space where many stocks don’t offer a payout to shareholders.

To that point, Electronic Arts’ Q1 earnings are expected to skyrocket 215% to $1.01 per share compared to EPS of $0.32 a year ago. First-quarter sales are projected to climb 22% YoY to $1.59 billion.

Regaining the mojo it received from higher gaming during the pandemic, Electronic Arts’ annual earnings are anticipated to climb 25% in its current FY24 and rise another 10% in FY25 at $7.54 per share. Earnings estimates are modestly higher and Electronic Arts offers a 0.55% dividend yield in an industry that is focused on growth and rarely offers a payout.  Zacks Investment Research

Bottom Line

These consumer-centric companies are expected to have posted strong quarterly growth and now may be a good time to buy their stocks for a strengthening outlook.

The industry participants focus on expansion efforts, hotel conversions, strategic partnerships and loyalty programs. The industry has exhibited resilience behind cost-saving initiatives and digital enhancements. Hotel owners continue to focus on maintaining a balance between maximizing hotel profitability and driving guest satisfaction. The industry players, namely Marriott International, Inc. MAR, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. HLT and InterContinental Hotels Group PLC IHG, have been gaining from the prevailing scenario.

Industry Description

The Zacks Hotels and Motels industry comprises companies that own, lease, manage, develop and franchise hotels. Some vacation ownership and exchange companies are also part of the industry. Several industry participants own, develop and operate resorts. Some companies develop lodges, villages and mobile accommodations, including modular, skid-mounted ones, and central amenities that provide long-term and temporary workforce accommodations. Some industry players develop, market, sell and manage vacation ownership and associated products. Few hoteliers also offer studios, one-bedroom suites and accommodations to mid-market business and personal travelers.

4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Hotels & Motels Industry

Strong RevPAR & ADR Driving Growth: The industry benefits from robust ADR and RevPAR. Per STR, ADR and RevPAR for the week ended July 22 came in at $161.65 and $117.91, up 0.5% and 1.5%, respectively, compared with the same period’s levels in 2022. Occupancy for the week ended May 6 came in at 72.9%, up 0.5% year over year. Occupancy for the week ending Jul 22 was the highest level since the week of Aug 10, 2019. The uptrend was driven by a solid leisure demand in the United States. Hotel demands in 2023 are likely to be driven by leisure travelers from Europe and Asia-Pacific.

Digitalization to Drive Growth: Hotel owners are focused on maintaining the balance between maximizing hotel profitability and driving guest satisfaction. To this end, hoteliers have leveraged mobile and web check-in and mobile key technologies. These hoteliers have also increased the use of these digital tools to strengthen infrastructure, grow online package sales, enable self-service bookings, make real-time offerings and enhance the overall customer experience. This and an emphasis on pricing optimization and merchandising capabilities are likely to help hoteliers capture additional market share.

Initiatives to Attract Customers: Firstly, hoteliers are committed to comprehensive cleaning, disinfection and infectious disease prevention. They have instated a trained hygiene and well-being leader responsible for a clean and safe environment for staff and guests. Secondly, the companies have tried enhancing the contactless experience through mobile and web check-in and mobile key technologies.

High Costs & High Inflation Remain a Woe: Higher costs remain a concern for the industry participants. Worries about a global slowdown and a possible recession loom large over the stock market. High inflation is likely to curb consumer spending, which will hurt the industry.

2023-07-31T19:30:00+00:00,CSX and SMART-TD Partner to Deliver Enhanced Conductor Training with Additional Week of Hands-on Experience,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla., July  31, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CSX (NASDAQ: CSX) and the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers — Transportation Division (SMART-TD) announced they are partnering to extend CSX’s conductor training program to five weeks from the previous four-week regimen to provide new hires with additional hands-on experience prior to beginning on-the-job training (OJT).

The extra week of training at the CSX Training Center in Atlanta will focus on performing tasks in a field setting to increase trainees’ exposure to railcar switching scenarios, radio communication, securement of equipment, brake tests and other fundamentals of the conductor’s role. Hands-on application of these skills begins in the third week of training, and the additional week will reinforce trainees’ comfort level by providing multiple opportunities to perform the tasks while operating on first and second shifts.

“Training is the foundation of the CSX safety culture, and investing in employees is the most fundamental way we can prepare our train crew members for a safe, successful career on the railroad,” said Jamie Boychuk, executive vice president of Operations. “The additional week of new-hire training in Atlanta will help conductors strengthen their skills in preparation for their on-the-job training assignment.”

CSX developed the extended training program in consultation with the SMART-TD, which represents its train crew employees.

“We’re proud to continue working with CSX to improve the training curriculum for new hire trainmen, in the same spirit as we’ve worked together to increase compensation and expand our mentoring partnerships for trainees,” said Jeremy Ferguson, President of SMART-TD. “More training directly translates to better safety for our members and demonstrates our shared commitment to the CSX safety culture.”

After completing their five weeks at the Atlanta Training Center, new conductors begin up to five months of OJT at their hiring location, where they learn the physical characteristics and job assignments of their designated territory.

2023-07-28T16:06:44+00:00,Intel’s Surprise Earning Beat Is Not the Only Thing Making It a Long-Term Buy,"I didn’t expect much from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) last quarter, and I was pleasantly surprised when it announced results late on July 27.

Intel said it earned 13 cents per share on $12.9 billion in revenue for the quarter ending July 1. Analysts expected a loss of 3 cents per share and revenue of just $12.1 billion. Revenue was down 15% and earnings were down 54% from a year ago. The company estimated third-quarter earnings at 20 cents per share.

Before earnings, traders didn’t know how the results would shake out. Bears saw AI draining revenue from the former “Chipzilla.” Most investment analysts were on the sidelines. Shares jumped $2 in the aftermarket, to about $36.40.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

But that’s not the point, my friend.

The Foundry Business

Intel is really two businesses. The foundry business is in the process of being reborn, helped by subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act meant to “re-home” supply chains from China. Intel will be losing billions of dollars on this business until its Ohio plants come up to speed. Once they do, it will impact the industry far beyond Intel.

Big bucks are pouring into Intel Foundry Services. Start with $20 billion for new foundries in Ohio but don’t stop there. There is also up to $36 billion going into new European foundries. There’s Intel’s entry into analog chips by buyingTower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM). There are a growing number of foundry partnerships. Intel is taking the whole semiconductor industry along for this ride.

If you believe in a new “AI SuperCycle” in companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), then you expect these investments to pay off in time. If you’re looking to see why the U.S. economy refuses to roll over despite constant interest rate hikes, investments like Intel’s are a big part of the reason.

Story continues

Are there risks? You bet. Intel must perfect the EUV technology pioneered by Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) (known in the trade as TSMC) and powered by equipment from ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) in Europe. It must hire and train a huge new workforce, amidst faltering demographics and a stressed U.S. education system. Demand for these new products must hold up.

But I believe in America. I believe this will work.

The Software Business

While Intel was dithering over the last two decades, with marketing-based committees running the show instead of process engineers, hardware became software.

Nvidia and AMD don’t make chips. They create designs in software that fabricators like TSMC and, in time, Intel, turn into silicon.

The software side of Intel is second-rate. The cracks were papered over in the last decade by the cloud, which needed the cheapest central processing unit (CPU) chips, in quantity, to build hyperscale data centers. Its fall has come about because clouds are being upgraded with the fastest possible graphics processing unit (GPU) chips. Intel has been left behind.

It will take years to fix this, and it may never be fixed. Intel may remain a laggard in GPUs and could keep losing share in CPUs to AMD. That’s why Intel is putting investment elsewhere, into foundries and analog chips.

The Bottom Line on INTC Stock

Our Louis Navellier is right. Intel is not the best play for AI.

The best plays are in the application space, in software that can provide productivity gains when the Internet’s full database capability is applied to it. Software-as-a-Service companies like ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are going to take the lead.

But Intel may be the most essential play for AI. It may already be the second-largest chip foundry. In a few years it’s going to be the largest one. A lot of upcoming Nvidia and AMD chips will be made by Intel. They need to be made there, to fulfill their own promises.

This is why I’m keeping money in Intel stock. It’s not about this quarter’s earnings, as nice as they look, and barely about next year. It’s about the rest of the decade — and America’s place in the new economy.

2023-07-28T12:13:45+00:00,3 Semiconductor Stocks You Better Be Buying on Each and Every Dip,"Semiconductors are increasingly crucial as our economies become more digitized and everything gets connected. These trends bode well for top semiconductor stocks as the number of chips on devices and machines increases.

The iPhone moment of AI has arrived, meaning more chips to train AI models. Every company is considering AI regarding productivity and how it will disrupt their industries. As a result, demand for high-end chips with lots of processing power is growing.

But semiconductor usage is also growing in traditional industries. For instance, the semiconductor content in vehicles is rising. EVs require numerous chips for power electronics, battery management systems, motor control, and charging infrastructure. Moreover, modern infotainment, communication, and user interface features on modern vehicles need more semiconductors.

With increased applications, semiconductor demand will continue to grow. However, the semiconductor industry is very competitive, with multiple competitors in each segment. Therefore, it’s crucial to pick the winners.

Leading semiconductor stocks with high returns will outperform peers. The following companies dominate their categories and will capture most of the value.

One of the top semiconductor stocks to participate in the AI theme is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Its chips have the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO) and are currently the best in training AI models. These advantages are flowing directly to the company’s financials.

On May 24, the stock reported outstanding first-quarter fiscal 2024 results. Total revenues declined 13% year-over-year, but on a sequential basis, they grew 19% from Q4 FY2023.

The biggest surprise for the markets was their guidance for the second quarter. Management issued second-quarter revenue guidance of $11.00 billion, which was $4 billion above consensus.

Management highlighted that we are in the early innings of accelerated computing and generative AI. “A trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure will transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia.

Demand for Nvidia’s products is surging as companies enter the AI race. The firm has had to increase supply to meet the increasing demand. This demand bodes well for Nvidia’s revenue going forward.

So far, its H100 chip is the best in training AI models in the market. Notably, it enjoys a monopoly with very little competition. Although Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) recently launched a potential competitor, Nvidia has a greater than two-year head start. The MI300X is unlikely to challenge the H100’s dominance any time soon.

Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) produces analog chips for various applications. While its chips might not garner the buzz like AI chips, they are crucial in everyday applications. Its chips include data converters, embedded processors, amplifiers, radio frequency (“RF”) technologies and power management products.

The company focuses on high-quality analog chips that enable it to earn higher margins. Since these chips aren’t subject to Moore’s law, they have long product cycles and limited obsolescence risk.

Due to its prudent capital stewardship, Texas Instruments is a top semiconductor stock. Management aligns with shareholders focusing on maximizing free cash flow power share. Since 2004 it has grown the metric at an 11% annual rate.

Currently, the analog chip market is in a downturn, but no company is suited to handle the downturn better than Texas Instruments. While smaller players might struggle, it has a robust balance sheet to navigate the cycle. Furthermore, since its chips have long cycles, the company can build up inventory levels and then fulfill customer orders when the eventual recovery happens.

Taking a longer-term view, the demand for analog chips is growing. McKinsey expects the total automotive sensor market to reach $468 billion by 2030, representing a 5.6% CAGR. Texas Instruments generates 25% of revenues from automotive and is investing to meet this demand. It’s building new fabs to produce analog and embedded processing chips.

For now, TXN stock is one of the top semiconductor stocks to play the digitization and electrification trend. The stock trades at a forward P/E of 24. Additionally, the company pays an attractive 2.6% dividend. With an impressive dividend growth record for 17 consecutive years, expect them to continue flowing.

After the recent earnings-related sell-off, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the top semiconductor stocks to buy on dips. This semiconductor equipment supplier manufactures deep ultraviolet (DUV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines used in chip production.

Today, ASML has a monopoly on EUV lithography machines. This advanced equipment is crucial in making chips, and one machine can cost as much as $200 million. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Samsung, and Intel (NYSE: INTC) are its largest three customers.

Due to its monopoly, ASML enjoys tremendous profitability and is among semiconductor stocks with high returns. Over the past few years, gross margins have improved from 46% in FY2018 to over 50% in the last two years. At the same time, free cash flow per share has grown from $6.64 to $19.30 in FY2022.

Recently, ASML stock sold off after its earnings and disappointing TSMC results. The decline in TSMC’s revenues highlighted the likelihood of a prolonged downturn in the semiconductor equipment market. However, looking closely at ASML’s second quarter 2023 results paint a different picture.

For the quarter, revenues grew sequentially from €6.7 billion to €6.9 billion. In terms of YOY performance, revenue growth was 27.8%. Management also issued an optimistic outlook. “ASML expects strong growth for 2023 with a net sales increase towards 30% and a slight improvement in gross margin, relative to 2022,” said ASML President and CEO Peter Wennink.

Given the company’s dominant position, revenues will increase as accelerated computing and artificial intelligence grow. Buy ASML stock now for growth and returns.

2023-07-27T22:30:25+00:00,7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Before the Breakout,"Semiconductor stocks recently received news that bodes poorly for the sector overall: TaiwanSemiconductorManufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is now predicting a 10% sales slowdown in 2023. That figure was pegged at 5% only months ago. Given that TSMC is the foundry to most of the chip industry the slowdown has clear implications across the industry. However, there are still several semiconductor stocks to watch.

Chipmakers in the automotive, cell phone, and industrial sectors are expected to be affected negatively. However, AI chip sales are expected to be the lone bright spot in which growth should continue. The logical conclusion is that AI-oriented chip firms remain investment worthy which is exactly the thesis for the firms in this article on top semiconductor stocks to watch.

Semiconductor Stocks to Watch: ASML (ASML)  a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buy

ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) has already performed very well this year. The company is the leader in a niche market that includes few competitors at all and none which can match its technological capabilities. The result is that its shares can likely move even higher.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

ASML’s extreme ultraviolet technology is applied to its massive lithography machines used for the manufacture of the world’s most complex chips. No other firms are as capable as ASML in this regard. That means it essentially has a monopoly on the production and sale of these machines that cost hundreds of millions of dollars.

AI chip production is an order of magnitude more difficult which only gives ASML a greater advantage. Its lithography machines are going to continue to be in higher demand as firms look to produce AI chips en masse. That’s part of the reason ASML is confident that sales will increase by 30% in 2023. In turn, that confidence serves as a signal to investors that ASML stock is a buy at this time.

Semiconductor Stocks to Watch: Synopsys (SNPS)  A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneath

Story continues

The current race to design and produce AI chips benefits Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS). The company provides design automation software for the semiconductor industry. Synopsys’ DSO.ai product is an AI integration into the design software that searches for optimization targets in the design phase of chip manufacturing. The appeal of the product is obvious: Firms want optimized chips and Synopsys’ AI-driven software allows that to occur. Synopsys also has AI integrations for the verification and test phases of chip production, VSO.ai, and TSO.ai.

Synopsys saw its revenues increase in the most recent quarter and in the most recent trailing 6 months. However, net income fell slightly as higher costs eroded margins. It hasn’t much-affected share prices at all. Instead, they’ve risen quickly following the release as it exceeded guidance. It remains one of the lesser-discussed chip stocks but one which is very much worth considering for its overall utility within the sector.

Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com

Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) provides manufacturing equipment to the chip industry. Share prices for AMAT stock have fallen following the TSMC news, creating an opportunity.

Applied Materials is a more conservative semiconductor investment overall. It includes a dividend with a yield approaching 1%. During the most recent quarter, Applied Materials returned $219 million to shareholders via that dividend. The firm also repurchased an additional $800 million of shares. It’s clear that the company is more focused on shareholders than growth relative to younger chip firms. The point is that AMAT shares offer stability and price appreciation through the growing chip market opportunity.

Revenues increased by 6% while net income increased by 3%. Those metrics suggest Applied Materials is, again, a steady choice for more risk-averse investors. Like every other chip firm, Applied Materials recognizes the transformative power of AI for its business. The firm believes parallel innovation rather than serial innovation is the path forward. That means Applied Materials believes industry cooperation will push forward its progress.

Nvidia (NVDA)  tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocks

As I write this, Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock continues to fall the day after TSMC’s bad news. Meanwhile, the majority of other chip stocks have shown signs of a quick rebound. I think this is an obvious opportunity for Nvidia investors.

TSMC already noted that AI chips are the lone bright spot it sees in terms of revenues in 2023. And Nvidia is the biggest and best AI chipmaker. It’s really a very simple choice to be bullish on NVDA shares right now. Remember, Nvidia expects roughly $11 billion in sales in Q2 which is far greater than the $7 billion Wall Street had previously been expecting. That still remains and Nvidia won’t release those earnings until Aug. 21.

Shares are trading below $450 but analysts believe they could go as high as $767 in the next 12 months. Don’t be surprised if they rise dramatically again. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is set to begin an AI subscription model for 365 Office which should increase revenues. Other firms are going to drive value from AI chips as well and that means Nvidia could see even higher demand soon.

AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) offers a lot of potential for investors seeking a true breakout stock. Its breakout potential is all due to its competition with Nvidia in relation to AI chip dominance.

It’s no secret that Nvidia is winning to this point. Its chips are regarded to be the most advanced for AI applications which have caused share prices to skyrocket in 2023. For investors looking for a challenger to that dominant position, AMD is a clear choice. That pursuit could logically see AMD share break out at some point. As a result, purchasing now is probably a smart idea.

That said, let’s analyze AMD in relation to Nvidia and AI. MosaicML compared both firms’ second-best chips and found that AMD chips were roughly 80% as powerful as those from Nvidia. The company believes that further software updates should make the chips equivalent in terms of performance. The company went on to say that AMD excels at software whereas other firms have struggled. Importantly, software is one of the most powerful areas in which improvements to AI chips can be made. That further suggests that AMD is not very far behind Nvidia and that shares could soon benefit.

Marvell Technology (MRVL) A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.

Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.com

Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is a very heavily favored chip stock. The 30 analysts with coverage of the firm are in near unanimous agreement that it is a buy. There’s nearly 10% upside implied by those prices and Marvell Technology pays a dividend so returns could be even higher.

The company provides cloud-optimized chips and is one of the better data infrastructure firms in relation to semiconductors. Marvell Technology helps firms improve their data infrastructure either on-premise or through the cloud.

It is also one of the chip firms that has benefited from AI this year. CEO Matt Murphy earlier stated that AI revenues will accelerate in H2 of this year. The firm’s networking chips are its main AI product and manufacturing is just ramping up. The firm expects AI revenues to double next year after production comes online fully. That should set shares up for a breakout at some point.

In some sense, Qualcomm’s (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock might seem like a chipmaker to avoid on the TSMC news. TSMC was clear that it sees a slowdown in mobile phone chip production but again sees AI chip sales improving.

Qualcomm is a major mobile phone chip provider. It is an integral partner of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in particular. That relationship is set to continue to be strong through 2025 even as Apple begins to transition away from Qualcomm intending to bring production in-house.

iPhone sales aren’t slowing down. That means that Qualcomm should be fine. Its AI mobile phone chips are particularly strong and despite Apple’s desire to move away from Qualcomm, it isn’t that simple. Qualcomm has Apple cornered in that regard and as iPhone sales continue to be strong Qualcomm’s mobile chip sales should remain strong too. That seems to be what the market said the day after the TSMC news as shares rebounded by more than 4%.

2023-07-28T15:01:00+00:00,Pick These 4 Stocks With Superb Interest Coverage Ratio,"Given the current economic scenario, investors should gauge the changing market dynamics and accordingly chalk out a sturdy investment strategy. The Federal Reserve's most recent action of increasing the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points has propelled it to its highest level in 22 years. This decision, though aimed to check inflation, has stirred concerns among investors. As the benchmark interest rate climbs to a range of 5.25%-5.5%, investors may face challenges in balancing risk and return.

Well, you can simply arrive at a decision to buy or sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers. But such a strategy does not always warrant superior returns when the market is facing myriad issues. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is always required for a better investment decision.

Well, a company should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged with coverage ratios — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. Here we have discussed one such ratio called the interest coverage ratio.

Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.

Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. LECO, McKesson Corporation MCK, Atmos Energy Corporation ATO and O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. ORLY are four stocks with an impressive interest coverage ratio.

Why Interest Coverage Ratio?

The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt.

Debt, which is crucial for most companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profits of a company. The company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, the interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.
The interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.

An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.

What’s the Strategy?

Apart from having an interest coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.

Interest coverage ratio greater than X-Industry Median

Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.

5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.

Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.

Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.

VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.

Here are four of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:

Lincoln Electric Holdings, a leader in the engineering, design, and manufacturing of advanced arc welding solutions, automated joining, assembly and cutting systems, plasma and oxy-fuel cutting equipment, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of B. The expected EPS growth rate for three-five years is 15%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lincoln Electric Holdings’ current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 13.7% and 9.4%, respectively, from the year-ago period. Lincoln Electric Holdings has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4%, on average. The stock has risen 39.8% in the past year.

McKesson, which provides healthcare services in the United States and internationally, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A. The expected EPS growth rate for three-five years is 10.9%.

2023-07-28T10:21:30+00:00,Here's Why We Think O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) Might Deserve Your Attention Today,"For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.

Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.

Check out our latest analysis for O'Reilly Automotive

O'Reilly Automotive's Earnings Per Share Are Growing

If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Shareholders will be happy to know that O'Reilly Automotive's EPS has grown 22% each year, compound, over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.

Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. While we note O'Reilly Automotive achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 11% to US$15b. That's progress.

Fortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of O'Reilly Automotive's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.

Are O'Reilly Automotive Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?

We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$56b company like O'Reilly Automotive. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$568m. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!

It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to O'Reilly Automotive, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$12m.

O'Reilly Automotive's CEO took home a total compensation package of US$5.5m in the year prior to December 2022. That's clearly well below average, so at a glance that arrangement seems generous to shareholders and points to a modest remuneration culture. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.

Should You Add O'Reilly Automotive To Your Watchlist?

You can't deny that O'Reilly Automotive has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. If you still have your doubts, remember too that company insiders have a considerable investment aligning themselves with the shareholders and CEO pay is quite modest compared to similarly sized companiess. This may only be a fast rundown, but the key takeaway is that O'Reilly Automotive is worth keeping an eye on. We should say that we've discovered 3 warning signs for O'Reilly Automotive (1 shouldn't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.

There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a free list of them here.

I'd like to begin our call today thanking Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to consistently providing excellent service to our customers. Our team's proven ability to execute our business strategy at a high level drove our second quarter comparable store sales increase of 9%, exceeding our expectations on both the professional and DIY sides of our business.
For the first 6 months of 2023, we generated a 9.8% increase in comparable store sales, which is the direct result of our team's unrelenting focus on providing the best customer service in our industry. Our team members and our culture remain our greatest assets. I made the exact same statement on our first quarter call, but it warrants repeating.
Our commitment to strengthening our culture and investing in our team is paying clear dividends in our continued strong performance. And I want to congratulate all of Team O'Reilly on another outstanding job in the second quarter.
Driven by the strength of our top line performance, we're also pleased to deliver a robust 16% increase in diluted earnings per share. Our operating cost spend was elevated above our expectations, which Brad will discuss more -- in more detail during his prepared comments, but we remain pleased with the investments we have made in our business to build on the momentum our teams are generating.
Our EPS results reflect our ability to produce strong, compounding operating profit dollar growth, and we are committed to aggressively capitalizing on the opportunities we see to provide enhanced value for our customers and earn even greater market share.
As a result of our strong top line performance, we are increasing our full year 2023 EPS guidance to a range of $37.05 to $37.55, reflecting our second quarter results and shares repurchased since our last call. At the midpoint of this revised range, we now expect our full year EPS to increase 12% over 2022.
As we disclosed in our press releases last night, after 41 years of service to our company, I've made the decision to retire next January. At that time, Brad Beckham will take over my role as Chief Executive Officer with direct responsibility to the Board as the leader of our executive team. We will also be promoting Brent Kirby to the role of company President. As you know, Brad and Brent assumed the roles of Co-President earlier in the year, and they have both taken on increasing levels of responsibility and prominence in the leadership of our business over the past several years.
Succession planning has always been a very important and methodical process at our company. In many ways, our upcoming change mirrors the successful leadership transitions we have seen before in our company's history, including when Jeff Shaw and I were elevated to lead the company in 2018 and Greg Henslee and Ted Wise were selected as the first non-O'Reilly family members in the top leadership roles of CEO and COO in 2005. Brad and Brent are both extremely talented and experienced individuals who have the full support of our team, and I have every confidence they will continue to deliver on our company's long-term track record of success. Over the period of now -- from now through January 31, we will complete the transition of the day-to-day operations of the company to Brad and Brent.
Finally, Greg Henslee, our Executive Chairman; and David O'Reilly, our Executive Vice Chairman, will also be continuing in their roles and along with our full Board will support Brad, Brent and our executive team in executing our strategy and driving long-term value for our shareholders.
As I finish up in my prepared comments, I would like to again thank our team for continuing to provide industry-leading customer service every day and generating excellent results in the first half of 2023. I'm extremely proud of all of you, and I'm excited to keep the momentum strong in the back half of the year.
I'll now turn the call over to Brad Beckham. Brad?

Brad W. Beckham

Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I would like to begin by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another excellent performance in the second quarter. Our continued industry-leading sales performance is the direct result of our team's unwavering commitment to our company's culture of providing excellent customer service, and I would like to thank all of our team members for their hard work and dedication.
Over the last several quarters, our team has generated tremendous momentum in our business, and that strength carried into the second quarter, driving our outstanding top line sales performance. As we've discussed on our last quarter's conference call, we faced some pressure from the timing of spring weather at the end of the first quarter, but our business rebounded with the onset of normal spring weather in April.
Those strong sales trends continued throughout the quarter, resulting in our outperformance versus our expectations in each month of the quarter. From a cadence perspective, our results were very steady in each month of the quarter both in absolute terms and as compared to our expectations.
The ability of our team to drive high levels of sustained sales growth month after month is the product of consistent daily execution of our key business fundamentals. And I couldn't be more pleased with how consistently Team O'Reilly has performed in the first half of 2023.
Now I would like to provide additional details on our sales performance in professional and DIY. Our professional business was again the outperformer in the second quarter. Our team delivered a mid-teens comparable store sales increase in our professional business in the quarter with incredibly strong growth coming on top of double-digit professional comps in the second quarter of 2022.
The compounded gains we are seeing on this side of our business reflect a sustained high level of customer service and execution that has allowed us to translate increased sales gains into future business opportunities. Every chance we have with a professional customer to prove our exceptional value gives us the ability to earn the next call and capture even more of that customer's business.
As we have seen our business grow over the last few years, our store teams have made the most of these incremental opportunities, and we continue to see runway to leverage our proven business model and execution to gain market share.
Turning to DIY. We continue to be reasonably pleased with this side of our business with our teams delivering steady comparable store sales growth, consistent with our overall trends in the first quarter. As we move past the spring weather volatility we experienced at the end of the first quarter and beginning of the second quarter, our DIY business has been very steady with consistently positive performance in each month of the quarter.
Our comparable store sales increase in our DIY business was driven by increased average ticket values aided by same SKU inflation, but we were also pleased to see flat DIY ticket count comps in the second quarter. Average ticket growth was in the mid-single digits on a combined basis for both sides of our business and drove the larger share of our comparable store sales increase. However, strength in ticket count comps, especially in our professional business, was the larger contributor to our outperformance versus our expectations.
Our average ticket growth was driven primarily by same-SKU inflation, which was in line with our expectations, coupled with a modest benefit from product mix and complexity in our professional business. As anticipated, same-SKU inflation we realized in the second quarter ticked down from the tailwind we saw in the first quarter. We continue to expect to see this benefit moderate in the back half of 2023 as we lap impact of 2022 price increases. This dynamic was built into our initial guidance expectations and remains unchanged.
To wrap up my comments on sales, I would like to highlight our updated sales guidance and full year outlook. From a macro perspective, we continue to remain bullish on the strength of our industry and prospects for the remainder of 2023. Our customer base has continued to be very resilient and willing to prioritize the maintenance and repair of their existing vehicles in order to avoid taking on a payment for newer, more costly vehicles.
While we still maintain an element of caution with regard to the outlook for the overall U.S. economy and the potential for heightened economic pressures, we believe that current market dynamics combine to provide a strong backdrop for demand in our industry.
In light of this backdrop, we are increasing our full year comparable store sales guidance to a range of 5% to 7% from our previous range of 4% to 6% with a corresponding increase in total sales guidance to $15.4 billion to $15.7 billion. This increase reflects our year-to-date performance through today's call. As I've already discussed, we anticipate moderation in our comparable store sales expectations in the back half of the year as we realize less built-in benefit from same SKU increases.
Our expectations also incorporate more challenging ticket count comparisons as we move through the back half of the year. The combined impact of both of these factors is driving the anticipated deceleration in our comparable store sales guidance in the second half of 2023 versus the 9.8% increase we generated in the first 6 months of 2023. However, our teams remain highly motivated to take share in every market, and we remain diligent in delivering a high level of customer service to accelerate our sales momentum.
Before I move on from sales, I will add that we are pleased to be off to a strong start in the third quarter as we have seen the robust sales trends in the first half of the year continue with incremental strength from the extreme heat in many of our markets in the first few weeks of July.
Now I would like to discuss our second quarter SG&A results, which came in higher than our original expectations for the quarter and were above the long-term growth rate necessary to operate our business model. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 30.3%, a deleverage of 71 basis points from the second quarter of 2022. This deleverage was driven by an increase in SG&A per store of approximately 10%. This heightened level of SG&A was incorporated in part into our initial expectations for 2023 but ultimately came in higher than anticipated driven by a few key factors I will briefly recap.
Coming into 2023, we identified several key initiatives targeted to enhance our long-term operational strength with an intent to capitalize on the considerable momentum we have generated in our business to further separate ourselves from the competition and consolidate the market. We have been pleased with the progress of these initiatives and in a few instances, realized an opportunity to accelerate these investments in the second quarter.
A good example relates to our plans this year to increase our spend on refreshing the image and appearance of our stores, which is targeted at both strategic projects as well as improved general maintenance of our existing facilities. We have sought to return to a new normal post pandemic. We have been -- excuse me, as we have sought to return to a new normal post pandemic, we have been working hard to catch up on deferred maintenance needs of our stores that have unfortunately accumulated over the last couple of years.
As a result, part of our SG&A pressure in the second quarter was driven by going faster than originally planned to address this issue. The image, appearance and shoppability of our stores is incredibly important to our ability to drive DIY traffic, customer satisfaction and in turn share gains over time. We have also seen good traction in our efforts to enhance our team member experience and benefits.
Our initiatives here have reaped better-than-expected team member retention but have also contributed to the overall cost of these enhancements, which coupled with the deferred compensation SG&A headwind Jeremy will discuss in a moment, added to our SG&A growth in the quarter.
Outside of these deliberate decisions to enhance our business, we unfortunately also faced pressure during the quarter from a higher-than-expected self-insured auto liability exposure driven by inflation and claim costs. Ultimately, we remain -- we retain control of our most significant driver of our total SG&A spend and the decisions we make around store payroll and appropriate staffing levels within our stores. Ensuring we have the strongest possible team delivering the best customer service in the industry is one of the most important, if not the most important driver of our long-term success.
Our total payroll spend in the second quarter was another contributor to the higher-than-normal SG&A per store increase driven by total head count and staffing levels, coupled with higher incentive compensation with wage rates largely in line with our expectations. As we have discussed often in the past, we manage this key component of our SG&A spend with a long-term focus. As we have continued to see our business accelerate over the last year-plus since exiting the pandemic, we have prioritized ensuring that our stores are delivering a high level of service on both sides of our business.
When we gain share with new and existing customers as we have seen over the last 2 years, we create an opportunity to prove our industry-leading value proposition as a trusted supplier and in turn earn repeat expanded business. In these situations, we are judicious about how we manage staffing levels to ensure we are delivering the excellent customer service that develops and maintains long-term relationships.
As we look forward to the balance of the year, we now expect to see an SG&A per store increase of approximately 6%, which reflects our first half results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Implicit in this guidance is our expectation that per store SG&A growth will moderate versus what we have seen in the first half of 2023 even as we continue to pursue strategic initiatives in our business.
We remain highly committed to expense control as a culture value and have set high expectations for the long-term productivity of the investments we're making today. We have a long track record of diligently managing our expenses to match the business conditions we are seeing in our markets, and we will continue to prudently adjust our operating cost structure to drive long-term value in our business. Finally, we still continue to expect our full year operating profit margin to come in within the range of 19.8% to 20.3% of sales.
Before I turn the call over to Brent, I would like to thank our entire team for their unwavering hard work and commitment so far in 2023. I am extremely humbled to have the opportunity to service our next -- our company's next Chief Executive Officer. And I couldn't be more excited to work side by side with our over 88,000 dedicated parts -- professional parts people to provide the best service possible to our customers and in turn drive outstanding performance for years to come.
Now I'll turn the call over to Brent.

Brent G. Kirby

Thanks, Brad. And I would like to join Greg and Brad in congratulating Team O'Reilly on the strength of our performance in the second quarter. Our strong top line sales performance and continued ability to outperform the market and gain share is a direct result of our team's relentless commitment to providing excellent customer service. And I want to thank all of our team members for their dedication to our company and to our customers.
Now, I will walk through our second quarter gross margin results, what we are seeing in the competitive environment and discuss our investments in inventory, exciting developments in our store and distribution growth and capital expenditures.
Beginning with gross margin. Our second quarter gross margin of 51.3% was down just 6 basis points from the second quarter of 2022 and at the top end of our expectations. Our second quarter of 2023 represents the first quarter after we have fully lapped the rollout of our professional pricing initiative and atypical LIFO impacts, which provides us a much clearer read on a year-over-year gross margin performance, excluding the noise that these factors have caused in prior quarters.
We are pleased with the stability of our gross profit results, especially in light of the pressure we continue to face from the extremely strong performance of our professional business. As this side of our business has continued to outperform, we have faced mix headwinds to gross margin but have been able to offset this pressure with incremental improvements in acquisition cost, solid leverage of distribution expenses and positive shrink results.
I would also like to provide some color on the cost and pricing dynamics we are seeing in our industry, both on the acquisition side of our supply chain and across the competitive environment in our markets. The short and sweet answer is that our industry remains rational and cost and pricing continue to be very stable, consistent with what we have seen over the past several quarters. Our supplier partners continue to see some degree of inflationary pressure, while at the same time, we have been able to realize incremental opportunities to reduce acquisition costs across some product categories.
These puts and takes are occurring in a much more normalized pattern than what we experienced in 2021 and 2022 and are in line with how we would view normal conditions in our industry from a historical perspective.
Pricing to DIY and professional customers in the industry has remained rational. And we have not seen significant changes in market pricing dynamics in the industry in 2023. Where we have seen increases in product acquisition and other costs, we continue to be successful in passing these increases through in selling price and are confident that this will continue into the future. As we have discussed many times on these calls, price is ultimately not always the deciding factor that determines where a customer will take their business.
Our team continues to perform at a high level by delivering industry-leading product availability and excellent customer service, and these strengths have enabled us to win share at appropriate gross margins in a competitive industry.
As we move into the back half of 2023, our gross margin results can vary based on product sales mix in any individual quarter or the timing of the pass-through of acquisition cost changes. But we are maintaining our full year gross margin guidance and continue to expect the back half of the year to fall within the 50.8% to 51.3% range.
Inventory per store finished the quarter at $762,000, which was in line with our expectations, up 12% from this time last year and 4% compared to the beginning of the year. We continue to track toward our planned inventory per store increase of 2% by the end of 2023. Our AP-to-inventory ratio at the end of the second quarter was 134%, in line with the beginning of the year and slightly better than our expectations, supported by strong sales volumes and inventory turns.
We are pleased with the health of our supply chain and continued improvements in store in-stock position. It is clear to us that our industry-leading inventory availability has been a key factor driving our robust sales results, and we continue to prioritize deploying the right inventory at the optimal position in our DC, hub and store network.
Turning to our growth initiatives and capital investment. We are extremely excited to complete the very successful opening of our first new O'Reilly distribution center in Guadalajara, Mexico earlier in July. This 370,000 square foot facility will have the capacity to ultimately service 250 stores in the Guadalajara Metro area and surrounding regions in Mexico.
Even more importantly, our new facility will be a game changer for our business model in Mexico. Since our entry into Mexico in 2019, we have supported our inventory strategies by utilizing a network of smaller distribution centers and warehouses that were part of the historical operations of Mayasa. Our new facility gives us the ability to deploy a much more significant inventory investment and leverage this enhanced and highly competitive inventory availability position.
It is our goal in Mexico, just as in all our domestic markets, to be the industry leader in putting the right part in the hands of our customers faster than the competition. And our new facility in Guadalajara provides the necessary platform to execute our strategy. We have a long history of successful distribution center openings, but each new facility is a significant undertaking and requires incredible hard work and coordination across our organization.
We could not be more pleased with the partnership between our U.S. and Mexico teams that drove the highly successful acquisition, development and opening of this new facility. It is an understatement to say that our store teams in Mexico are very energized by the opportunities that our new distribution center unlocks. And they are dedicated to leveraging all of our competitive advantages as they outwork the competition to grow market share.
From a store growth perspective, we successfully opened 42 stores during the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to 100 net new store openings. Our team is on pace to hit our plan of 180 to 190 net new store openings for 2023. Our openings in the first half of the year were very well balanced across our store footprint with new stores coming online in 34 different states, Puerto Rico and Mexico.
Our ability to spread our growth across many markets positions us to be highly selective in hiring and training the outstanding teams that drive the success of our new stores. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our new stores and view our organic store growth as a key priority for our use of capital.
Total capital expenditures for the first 6 months of 2023 were $461 million, up substantially from the first 6 months of 2022, but in line with our ambitious plans to deploy capital against projects and initiatives that will drive long-term growth and operational gains for our business. We remain on target to hit our capital expenditure guidance range of $750 million to $800 million.
To close my comments, I want to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their hard work and continued dedication to our customers. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeremy.

Jeremy Adam Fletcher

Thanks, Brent. I would also like to thank Team O'Reilly for their continued hard work and exceptional professionalism. Now we will cover some additional details on our second quarter results and guidance for the remainder of 2023.
For the quarter, sales increased $398 million driven by a 9% increase in comparable store sales and a $75 million noncomp contribution from stores opened in 2022 and 2023 that have not yet entered the comp base.
Brad covered our SG&A expense in the quarter in detail, but I did want to provide some additional color on our deferred compensation plan expenses given the nature of how this plan runs through our income statement. For many years, the company has sponsored a nonqualified deferred comp plan for team members whose participation would otherwise be limited in our qualified 401(k) plan. Since this is a nonqualified plan, the company maintains a liability for the obligation to pay the value of the deferred compensation to team members in the future, adjusted to reflect asset performance and also holds a corresponding asset for the fully funded and participant-directed assets in the plan.
However, market value changes in the plan are reflected on different line items on our income statement with an increase in value driving an increase in SG&A expense and an offsetting benefit below the line in other income. Historically, the net impact has not been significant to either line item, but given the increased size of the planned assets and the more significant market value changes both in the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, we wanted to highlight the difference so that you will be able to update your models.
The year-over-year swing in the market values of planned assets drove a $9 million increase in SG&A expense or 24 basis points with a corresponding $9 million year-over-year favorable change in other income and expense.
Our second quarter effective tax rate was 22.5% of pretax income, comprised of a base rate of 24.3%, reduced by a 1.8% benefit from share-based compensation. This compares to the second quarter 2022 rate of 23.8% of pretax income, which was comprised of a base rate of 24.3% reduced by 0.5% benefit from share-based compensation. Our second quarter base tax rate was in line with our expectations with the total effective tax rate below our expectations due to the higher-than-planned benefits from share-based compensation.
For the full year of 2023, we now expect an effective tax rate of 22.5% comprised of a base rate of 23.4%, reduced by a benefit of 0.9% from share-based compensation. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate is expected to be lower than the other 3 quarters due to the totaling of certain tax periods. Variation in the tax benefit from share-based compensation can create fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate.
Now we will move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results. Free cash flow for the first 6 months of 2023 was $1.2 billion, in line with the first half of 2022, with growth in income and a benefit from favorable timing of tax payments and disbursements for renewable energy tax credits, offset by increased capital expenditures in 2023 versus the prior year and a lower benefit from a reduction in net inventory this year versus 2022. For 2023, we now expect free cash flow at a range of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion, up $100 million from our previous guidance range based on operating cash flow performance in the first half of the year.
Moving on to debt. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.92x, which is up compared to our end of 2022 ratio of 1.84x with the increase driven by borrowings on our revolving credit facility. We continue to be below our leverage target of 2.5x and plan to prudently approach that number over time.
We continue to be pleased with the execution of our share repurchase program. And during the second quarter, we repurchased 0.8 million shares at an average share price of $904.37 for a total investment of $680 million. Year-to-date, through our press release yesterday, we repurchased 2.2 million shares at an average share price of $855.22 for a total investment of $1.9 billion. We remain very confident that the average repurchase price, inclusive of the current excise tax cost, is supported by the discounted expected future cash flows of our business, and we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning excess capital to our shareholders.
As a reminder, the updated EPS guidance outlined by Greg earlier includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call but does not include any additional share repurchases.
Finally, before I open up our call to your questions, I would like to again thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued dedication to the company's long-term success.
This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I would like to ask Matthew, the operator, to return to the line, and we will be happy to answer your questions.

Question and Answer Session

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Your first question is coming from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.

Simeon Ari Gutman

It's Simeon Gutman. Congratulations to Brad, Brent and Greg. My first question is market share. It looks like the spread with O'Reilly in the industry is accelerating, at least it has in this calendar year. A question as to what do you attribute it. The only thing that we could put our finger on is a year ago, the PPI initiative. So maybe it just took a year for those investments to rue. So curious what you're take on the market share acceleration is due to.

Brad W. Beckham

Yes. Simeon, thanks. It's Brad. Yes, I think the PPI is a little bit easy to point to because it's a little bit more tangible for everybody who looks into our company. But I would say that if you talk to our operators like we do every day, the biggest thing we're seeing is just a huge opportunity starting with our team, our culture. The things we've done to stabilize our team to rebound from kind of the COVID hangover in terms of some of the turnover and maybe what was subpar for us from a service standpoint is we just feel really great, first and foremost, about the teams we build, what we're doing with our human capital and the service that our store teams, our distribution teams and our corporate offices are providing.
Second thing I would say is that, especially from operations and sales, the first thing they point to when we talk to them about what we're seeing in the market, Simeon, is the position we're in from a supply chain standpoint. As you know as good as anybody, our immediacy of need in nondiscretionary business, it's all about -- on both sides of the business, it's all about who has the right part at the right place at the right time. 
And I just couldn't be more pleased with the job that Brent and the merchant team, the inventory management purchasing team and our distribution teams are doing for our store operators. They have just got us in a better position than we've been in a long time. And we feel like we're playing from a position of strength from the team side, from the supply chain side and all the work we're doing with our professional customers out in the field every day making sales calls. And then obviously, we still feel good about everything we did with PPI.

Gregory D. Johnson

Yes. Simeon, if I could maybe add to what Brad said there, first of all, thanks for the congrats. And Brad did a nice job of expressing confidence in the supply chain team and our inventory position. Obviously, as we've said over and over again, we've got to be competitive on price, which we are and continue to be and will continue to be. But what outweighs price is inventory availability and service level. And Brad and his teams in the field have just done an outstanding job of making sure we're positioned to provide the highest level of service in the industry.

Simeon Ari Gutman

Yes. And maybe the follow-up on that point, this year, you're investing it sounds like a little more at stores to get the experience improved. Service was part of it. Is there a case that you should continue to lean in given that you have transitions happening at competitors? Might we see that the flow-through be a little weaker, as you should just lean into the business especially given how strong it is? Is that a thought that investment mode may continue?

Jeremy Adam Fletcher

Yes. Great question, Simeon. And I think you've picked up, I think, the key thesis behind this. As we've talked about it, really all year, they're coming into 2023. We've just identified areas that we felt really from a long-term perspective allow us to invest within our business and continue to really double down on the momentum that we've seen.
For us to have, I think, such a sustained expense control culture within our organization for such a long period of time, that's a substantial undertaking to think about it in those ways and to move forward. And absolutely, as we've done that, that has been very focused and targeted towards a strong return on those dollars that we're spending in. And we've thought about that from a long-term perspective.
We -- here we are, we sit in July halfway through a year, and I think we've given clear expectations around where we think we'll finish out the year. And funny, we don't really provide guidance for 2024 until later on and we get closer. So I think it's a little bit premature for us to, I think, talk too specifically about that.
For sure, 2023 has been a high year for us. But at the same time, to your question, I'm not going to say that as we move forward, we won't find other opportunities for us to invest in our business, and we'll continue to do so aggressively where we feel like that's appropriate.
Having said that, we have an expense control focus. We're diligent in how we manage to that. And it's our expectation that we'll continue to see the levels of productivity on a long-term basis and improvements in how we think about the returns on our operating cost spend that is consistent with what we've seen over the long course of our business.

Simeon Ari Gutman

Well done. Good luck in the second half.

Gregory D. Johnson

Thanks, Simeon.

Brad W. Beckham

Thanks, Simeon.

Operator

Your next question is coming from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI.

Gregory Scott Melich

My first question is on the same-SKU rate of disinflation. I think you said it's coming in as planned. Could you just update us on what that actually was in the quarter and what you expect it to be in the back half?

Jeremy Adam Fletcher

Yes, Greg. We -- I think we had said that it was mid-single digits in the quarter. We think that moderates in the back half of the year. It won't get all the way to flat. But we would expect it to -- by the time we kind of exit this year, at that stage, you're really just talking about kind of what we've seen in the current year from a year-over-year perspective.
And we've kind of -- as Greg mentioned in -- or I'm sorry, as Brent mentioned in his comments, we've kind of normalized to what we think are more kind of historical long-term rates there. So that would -- that puts you kind of in the low single-digit range. But really, as Brent mentioned, that's all falling -- almost directly in line with what we would have anticipated for this year.

Gregory Scott Melich

Got it. And then maybe you talk a little bit about the category mix that you're seeing in both pro and DIY. It sounded like some of the bigger-ticket stuff with some of your competitors got a little softer, maybe some trade-out happening in those categories or batteries, how some of these things are doing on both sides of the house.

Brent G. Kirby

Yes, Greg. Well, I'll speak to a little bit of that in terms of categories at a high level. I mean we always are looking for -- we have complete lines across good, better, best product offerings. We're always looking, is there any trade-down, trade-across, trade-up, depending on where the consumer is.
And similar to what we saw in the first quarter and how we answered this question on the call a quarter ago, we actually saw a little bit of a trade-up from better to best and good kind of stayed where -- at the normal baseline that we've seen historically there. So we're not seeing trade-down with the consumer at this point.
I mean in terms of categories where we have seen strength, I would attribute a lot of that strength to better in-stock position in categories like radiators and, in some case, brake components versus where we were a year ago on a comparable basis or even where we were in first quarter on some of those categories. So we continue to see our store in-stock position improve. And as we talked about in our prepared comments, we really believe that's a huge contributor to our share gains.

Gregory D. Johnson

Yes, Greg, this is Greg. I just might add one comment there. In addition to what Brent said, we continue to also see strength and growth in our proprietary brands as well. They currently make up over half of our sales overall.

Gregory Scott Melich

Got it. That's great and good luck.

Brad W. Beckham

Yes. Thanks, Greg. Appreciate it.

Operator

Your next question is coming from Chris Horvers from JPMorgan.

Christopher Michael Horvers

Congratulations to everybody on their updates. My first question is as you -- can you talk about what you're seeing from a national accounts versus the ""up and down the street"" business perspective? Is one of relative strength? Are you seeing any pricing differential in those 2 businesses? It sounds like the answer is no. And then lastly, I think it would be helpful maybe if you could size how much national accounts contribute to the overall business.

Brad W. Beckham

Chris, it's Brad. I'll start this one, and a couple of others may want to jump in. But great question. I think, as you know, us growing our company over the last few decades from humble beginnings here in the center part of the country and growing out toward the coast through acquisition and greenfield expansion. We founded our company on the independent garage, the -- what you call the ""up and down the street"" accounts, the small everything from a shade tree mechanic to the larger independent garages that compete very well with the larger players.
And then obviously, as we've grown over time, you have your small accounts, you have your midsized accounts. And then obviously, we do have a sizable book of strategic account business that's made up of both national players and regional players.
Part of that, as you know, Chris, is we still have that gap in footprint. We have kind of in the upper Mid-Atlantic and going up into New York in those markets that doesn't always match up with some of the biggest national players. So that's still an opportunity for us as we build out the U.S. But really from what we've seen from your direct question about kind of what we're seeing in our share gains and momentum and how that relates to pricing on the street, we're seeing every bit of our business grow very consistently from the small shops, the larger independent garages, our strategic accounts, all that is very consistent in what we're seeing.
And we've never quantified the exact how that splits out between our strategic and our other book of business. But I would tell you that our -- by far, the foundation of our professional business is the independent garage in the way that we built that from the ground up.

Jeremy Adam Fletcher

Yes. Chris, I'd just add one thing to that, maybe in respect to your size question. Brad talked about it, those are -- the national and regional account, they're very important customers to us. They're an important part of our business. But we may differ from others in that the relative size of that business for us is not so significant that it's a huge need to move into our overall performance.
It's important, as Brad mentioned. It's grown consistently well along with the rest of our business. But it's not a dynamic that has caused our results to be significantly different than the broader base of business.

Christopher Michael Horvers

Got it. My follow-up question is for you, Jeremy. I mean, if you look back historically, gross margin seasonality is pretty flattish over the year, ex periods where you have inflation or deflation -- I'm sorry, like -- yes, inflation or disinflation in the business. And you talked about things getting back to normal. So I guess, does that -- would that suggest that the back half of the year is maybe in the sort of the upper half of your guide sort of consistent with the year-to-date level?

Jeremy Adam Fletcher

Yes -- no. Thanks, Chris. I appreciate the question. And you've been around our story for a really long time to go back to those periods when you could say that the quarter-to-quarter wasn't impacted by some of the noisy items. The LIFO story itself has been a long history. But I think you're appropriate to identify that, generally speaking, seasonality, it has some impact on our gross margin results. Product mix in any quarter can have some impact as well. But they're going to be, I think, much less muted moving forward than some of the larger variances we've seen.
I'd tell you, we'd be cautious in saying the guidance would be in the back half of the year -- or is it in the top half of the range in the back half of the year for no other reason than we've seen our professional business continue to perform well.
And we give a guidance range for a reason. There's going to be some degree of volatility around product mix and the timing of pricing, and Brent called those out in the script. But we feel comfortable with the guidance range that we've had and really with the strength of our gross margin as we've seen our business accelerate and be successful. It's important for us to be able to grow those sales in the right way, and we've seen that with, I think, the steadiness of our gross margin results.

Your next question is coming from Scot Ciccarelli from Truist.

Scot Ciccarelli

It's Scot Ciccarelli. We're hearing from the field that services facilities are seeing slower tire sales. Presumably, that would stem from increased economic pressures. So the questions are, a, are you hearing similar from your customers? And then, b, even though you guys don't sell tires, you would presumably sell parts on a car being brought in for service. So how much exposure to such a trend could O'Reilly have just from a customer standpoint?

Brad W. Beckham

Scot, it's Brad. As you said, we don't sell tires. And I want to be careful not to speak for the professional customer installer base. But what we see generally is kind of good and good, meaning if our shops are selling a lot of tires, then they have wheels off, they have -- they're looking at -- they're doing inspections, they're looking at brake parts, they're looking at the chassis, they're looking at a lot of different things.
But then if they're not selling tires, they have a little bit more time on their hands to spend a little bit more time with customers and diagnose better and potentially get ahead of some of the DIFM jobs. So I just want to be careful to answer that too pointed versus that population. But we haven't really seen anything with softer tire sales the way business comes to us. We really haven't seen anything on that front.

Jeremy Adam Fletcher

Yes. I think maybe just more broadly, Scot, the consumer that we engage in and interact with continues to be resilient and healthy. We -- as you know, we benefit from just the nature of our industry and the immediacy and need and the key value of that transportation demand being so high that we always tend to be a little bit lagging to others that start to see pressure there.
We're cognizant that in short periods of time, you could see customer reactions. But we still have a lot of confidence in what we see as we interact with our customers. They're valuing the proposition of keeping the cars on the road. There -- it's a good return on their investment. I think we'll continue to see that as we have in past economic cycles. But at this point, we haven't seen any of those types of things that you would point to that would indicate the customer -- or our customers suffering.

Brent G. Kirby

And maybe Scot, just maybe to add one other point to the points that Brad and Jeremy have already made. Interestingly enough, we've continued to see strength in undercar, ride control, chassis, a lot of those categories that are getting looked at when the car is up on the rack. So just throw that in as well for color.

Scot Ciccarelli

I appreciate that. And then just a quickie on accounts payable if inventory stays pretty elevated. Jeremy, is there any reason that should shift by the time we hit year-end? Or is it just the accelerated sales pace and we should continue to see kind of like 125%-, 130%-type ratio?

Jeremy Adam Fletcher

Yes, we would expect it would it would stay at reasonably elevated levels there. Sometimes it can moderate a bit just on seasonality of how some things flow through in the back half of the year within our free cash flow expectations. We've got a little bit of that built in. But we continue to see strong productivity out of existing inventory even as we've added over the course of the last year and the ability to turn that inventory helps us to maintain that negative net investment that is still nice to have.

Your next question is coming from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer.

Brian William Nagel

I would like to add my congratulations to the promotions all around. So the question I have -- the first question, just with respect -- I guess looking to the back half of the year, and you talked about sort of say, the waning benefits of, I guess, inflation from a sales perspective. But as we think about that then, should we also expect on the other side potentially -- at least the potential for more benefits on the gross margin front with potentially easing sourcing costs?

Brent G. Kirby

Yes. Brian, I can start on that. I mean I would just tell you, and I mentioned it in the script, a lot of suppliers are still under some pressure from increased cost of capital, increased raw materials, increased labor cost. I mean we do see that.
We also, though, are always aggressively looking at price and cost of goods and doing everything we can to drive out cost of goods and purchase the best we can. Greg talked a little bit earlier about proprietary brands and our continued strength we see in growth in those proprietary brands. That gives us an opportunity to shop that with multiple suppliers and be multi-sourced in those categories, which is certainly a strategic strength for us and an opportunity on the cost side.
But I would tell you, in general, the -- a lot of our suppliers would tell you, they're still under cost pressure, as you would expect them to report that. But we feel like we're in a very good position to mitigate that through this period and have done that in many cases.

Brian William Nagel

Got it. That's helpful. So my follow-up question, just with respect to June. So we've heard others in your sector talk about weaker June, and others in retail talk about a weaker June. I mean it sounds like your business was pretty steady. So I guess the question is, I mean, did you see anything in the month of June to suggest weakness? And if you didn't, can you -- is there an explanation of why O'Reilly performed so much better than others in that month?

Jeremy Adam Fletcher

To answer the question directly, right, we didn't see weakness in June. We were pleased with our results for the month. The compares obviously are different month-to-month. But relative to our expectations, it performed as strongly as in the other months, actually a little bit higher. The actual comp, they were all within a really tight band. So we feel positive.
We obviously week-to-week, month-to-month evaluate all of the individual drivers of our business. And I think it's tough in such a time period to be able to parse out too much what we see versus what others in the marketplace might see. But we saw solid demand really across regions, across categories throughout the quarter.

Brian William Nagel

I appreciate it. Congrats again.

Brad W. Beckham

Thanks, Brian.

Brent G. Kirby

Thanks, Brian.

Your next question is coming from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs.

Katharine Amanda McShane

We just wanted to make sure that aside from the moderating inflation and some of the challenging ticket count compares, if there was anything else driving the sequentially lower comp outlook for the second half of the year.

Jeremy Adam Fletcher

No, Kate. I mean, I think you've identified what really we've talked about since we established our guidance at the beginning of the year. Most of the cadence differences as we move quarter-to-quarter throughout 2023 in the actual math that pushes out our comp, it relates to the way volumes flowed in, in 2022. So for sure, there's a waning same-SKU benefit.
'22 is also a unique year for us, really on both sides of our business where from a transaction perspective, the back half was stronger than the first half for different reasons. The DIY, we faced some pressure in the front half of last year for just volatility in the overall macro economy and then responded better. And then on the professional side, we've continued to see ramp growth there from a transaction perspective.
Really, as we think about the balance of the year, nothing has changed about where we would expect on a sequential volume basis to be our overall business when we think week-to-week from a dollar standpoint. We're anticipating to remain consistent and strong. We're excited about the trends that we've produced in the business.

Your next question is coming from Mike Baker from D.A. Davidson.

Michael Allen Baker

Real quick, can you just talk about the heat that we're seeing throughout the country and how this impacts your business? And specifically, I think you said -- I hate to put -- to have 2 short term, but you said that July was continuing the strength that you saw in June with incremental benefit from the weather. So does that actually mean that July was better than June?

Brad W. Beckham

Thanks, Mike. It's Brad. Yes. As you know, heat -- we like heat, we like extremes, and we work in enough markets, especially where the hot weather really contributes to failure and weather be immediate. One thing to remember about heat is a lot of time, something like a battery, heat kills batteries, but then it fails in the winter. So we want to be a little bit cautious.
But overall, we're really excited about where our business is. We're excited where we ended the quarter, and we're really excited about how we started July. We're always a little bit careful with a 3-week period, but there's no doubt in our minds that what we're seeing in the market and -- relating to weather that the heat is good for us, and we're doing everything we can to capitalize on it.

Jeremy Adam Fletcher

Yes, Mike. Brad said it right. We don't ever overreact to 3-week periods of time. But it should come as no surprise, you walk outside, you know that, that hot weather is good for us. And that's how we would, I think, frame Brad's comments in the prepared comments around that is, yes, we've seen the benefit that you would expect to see with the weather we've had.

Michael Allen Baker

Great. Excellent. One more quick follow-up. The deferred compensation impact in the second quarter that you talked about, that $9 million shift, do we -- does that continue into the third and fourth quarter? I presume if it does or doesn't, that's in the guidance, but just trying to think about how to think about that in terms of our models.

Jeremy Adam Fletcher

Yes. We don't -- you know we don't do a lot of forecasting within our guide there. We hate to even talk about it, but it does create noise on that other income and expense line. It just really kind of depends on the broader market activity that impacts those accounts. And in normal periods, it's not a needle mover, but it just happened to coincide in the second quarter that it creates noise.

Michael Allen Baker

Understood. So in other words, it wasn't a catch-up in the second quarter. It has to do with, I presume, the increase in the stock price during the quarter.

Jeremy Adam Fletcher

Yes. When the market recovers, we see the liability go up, the assets go up. It's a net nothing. It literally -- it perfectly offsets, it just creates noise.

Michael Allen Baker

Right. It's important, though, because it makes looks like your SG&A is higher than expected and that the only reason why you beat earnings is because of below-the-line items. But -- so I think it's important to understand it's just a change in the geography.

Jeremy Adam Fletcher

Yes, agreed.

Your next question is coming from Seth Bashman (sic) [Seth Basham] from Wedbush Securities.

Seth Mckain Basham

Sales productivity on a per employee basis was very strong, reaching on a new record by my calculation. I mean, first, do you see this as sustainable? And then second, can you provide more color on wages and benefits in the quarter and how you expect them to trend going forward on a year-over-year growth basis?

Jeremy Adam Fletcher

Yes. So maybe I can start there and then others can chime in, Seth, and probably answer the second question first. Overall, from a workforce perspective, continuing to see pressure from a wage rate standpoint there. I'd tell you, it's largely in line with what we're seeing with the inflation benefit that we've seen on our top line. And all of that were within our expectations.
I know Brad talked about the SG&A as we've seen the opportunities to invest. But none of our spend outside of our original guide was driven by wage rates. Those were in line with where we had expected.
And we continue to anticipate that we'll have opportunities from an investment perspective in the team member experience enhancements that we've had. We felt very positive about those. I talked about those at length. Those start to moderate just on a comparison basis as we move throughout the year for the things that we've been executing.
In terms of where that's driven us from a productivity perspective on the sales per team member, absolutely. We're seeing a very robust top line. And Brad talked about it at length in the sense that we really believe that we're winning business based upon the strength of our team and the service and value that they're providing. And we think that our ability to double down on the strength of our team is really going to help us continue to sustain that and improve it as we move forward.

Seth Mckain Basham

Got it. Congrats to Greg, Brad and Brent.

2023-07-31T21:57:00+00:00,Advanced Micro Devices Q2 Preview: Time to Buy?,"It’s the busiest week of earnings season, with an extensive list of companies scheduled to unveil their quarterly results.

There are several notable names on the reporting docket, including the highly-followed Advanced Micro Devices AMD. AMD shares have been big-time outperformers in 2023 so far, up more than 70% following a brutal 2022 showing.

But how does the semiconductor titan stack up heading into its quarterly release? Let’s take a closer look at expectations and results from a few other chip players, including NXP Semiconductors NXPI and Intel INTC, as a light guide.

Intel

Intel posted better-than-expected Q2 results, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 420%. Quarterly revenue totaled $12.9 billion, 8% ahead of expectations and down from the year-ago quarter.

The market took the results in stride, with Intel shares finding plenty of buyers post-earnings. Impressively, both top and bottom line results exceeded the higher end of previous guidance. Zacks Investment Research

NXP Semiconductors

NXP Semiconductors also posted better-than-expected top and bottom line results, exceeding EPS expectations by 5% and delivering a 3% revenue beat. Similar to INTC, the company’s revenue results were at the high end of previous guidance, undoubtedly a positive.

And the market took the results well, with NXPI shares seeing bullish activity post-earnings. Zacks Investment Research

Advanced Micro Devices

Analysts have been silent for the quarter to be reported over the last several months, with the $0.57 per share estimate unchanged. The value reflects a 45% pullback in earnings from the year-ago quarter. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

The story remains primarily the same regarding the top line, with the $5.3 billion quarterly estimate down a fractional 0.1% since the beginning of May. Sales are forecasted to decline along with earnings, with the estimate suggesting an 18% pullback year-over-year.

Story continues Zacks Investment Research

In addition, AMD has been a consistent earnings performer as of late, exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations in nine of its last ten releases. Just in its latest print, AMD delivered a 7% EPS beat paired with a modest revenue surprise.

It’s worth noting that the market has been impressed with the last two releases, with AMD shares seeing notable bullish momentum post-earnings. This is illustrated by the green arrows circled in the chart below. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Investors will closely be monitoring AMD’s Data Center results, especially as Wall Street continues to obsess over artificial intelligence (AI). For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Data Center revenue stands at $1.3 billion, implying a pullback of roughly 9% from the year-ago quarter.

Putting Everything Together

Investors will closely be monitoring AMD’s quarterly results, as the stock has become a household name in the semiconductor space.

Several other semiconductor names, including Intel INTC and NXP Semiconductors NXPI, have already unveiled their respective quarterly results, with both companies posting better-than-expected results and seeing buying pressure post-earnings.

For Advanced Micro Devices’ AMD quarter to be reported, analysts have primarily left their top and bottom line expectations unchanged, with both earnings and revenue forecasted to pull back from the year-ago quarter.

2023-07-31T19:07:14+00:00,NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) Shareholders Will Want The ROCE Trajectory To Continue,"What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So when we looked at NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.

What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?

For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for NXP Semiconductors, this is the formula:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.19 = US$3.8b ÷ (US$24b - US$4.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).

Thus, NXP Semiconductors has an ROCE of 19%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 13% generated by the Semiconductor industry.

Check out our latest analysis for NXP Semiconductors  roce

In the above chart we have measured NXP Semiconductors' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our freereport for NXP Semiconductors.

What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us

NXP Semiconductors' ROCE growth is quite impressive. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 479% over the last five years. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.

What We Can Learn From NXP Semiconductors' ROCE

In summary, we're delighted to see that NXP Semiconductors has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. And a remarkable 149% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.

On a separate note, we've found  3 warning signs for NXP Semiconductors  you'll probably want to know about.

2023-07-31T17:25:10+00:00,UPDATE 1-On Semiconductor forecasts robust Q3 revenue on silicon carbide strength,"(Updates share price, adds comments from CEO interview)

By Zaheer Kachwala and Stephen Nellis

July 31 (Reuters) - Chipmaker ON Semiconductor Corp on Monday forecast third-quarter revenue above market estimates on optimism that strong demand from the automotive sector will offset broader weakness in the semiconductor industry.

Shares of the Arizona-based company were up more than 3.4% to $108.68 by midday after gaining 68.5% so far this year.

The rising adoption of electric vehicles has been a boon for chipmakers like Onsemi and NXP Semiconductors. Onsemi said in May it was considering investing over $2 billion to boost the production of silicon carbide chips used to extend the range of EVs.

Onsemi is considering existing sites in Korea, the United States and the Czech Republic for the new factory.

Hassane El-Khoury, the chipmaker's chief executive, told Reuters that the company is open to building brand new factories if demand continues to rise. But in the meantime, using an existing site will help bring the silicon carbide business's profit margins in line with the broader company's margins, even after accounting for spending money to expand production.

""At this at this point (an existing site) is the way to go, and we pay for it with operating cash flow,"" El-Khoury told Reuters.

Automotive chipmaker NXP last week forecast a strong third-quarter revenue and profit, exuding confidence over a steady automotive demand.

Onsemi, which makes sensors and supplies chips to companies like Volkswagen, expects revenue between $2.10 billion to $2.20 billion in the third quarter. Analysts on average expect revenue of $2.07 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Its forecast for adjusted earnings of $1.27 to $1.41 per share, was also above estimates of $1.21 per share.

For the second quarter ended June 30, the company's revenue rose to $2.09 billion, ahead of analysts' expectations of $2.02 billion. The revenue was boosted by Onsemi's power solutions group, which provides power management chips, making up about 53% of total quarterly revenue.

On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.33 per share in the reported quarter, compared with estimates of $1.21 per share, according to Refinitiv.

2023-07-30T11:01:31+00:00,Should You Think About Buying Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) Now?,"Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS). The company's stock saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Cintas’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.

See our latest analysis for Cintas

What's The Opportunity In Cintas?

The stock is currently trading at US$503 on the share market, which means it is overvalued by 28% compared to my intrinsic value of $391.70. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since Cintas’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.

Can we expect growth from Cintas? earnings-and-revenue-growth

Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Cintas' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 34%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? CTAS’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe CTAS should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.

Story continues

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CTAS for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for CTAS, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. While conducting our analysis, we found that Cintas has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore it.

2023-07-31T14:56:44+00:00,‘It’s a Profitable Time’: Billionaire Ken Fisher Stays Heavily Invested in These 2 ‘Strong Buy’ Stocks,"Ken Fisher

We have just been through a period of abundant stock market gains, but that is no coincidence, according to one legendary stock picker.

Ken Fisher calls the last 9 months the “midterm miracle.” That is, history has shown that the 9 months starting October of a midterm election year turn out to be the most consistently profitable period in the stock market in all stock market history. With the huge strides made since October 1 last year, this scenario has played out in a “picture perfect” way.

But what happens now that period has been and gone? Well, the Fisher Investments founder, whose net worth is valued at ~$7.2 billion, concedes that the back half of the year that follows isn’t quite as bountiful, but it is still meaningfully better than average. For example, normally, stocks rise 65-70% of the time, but in the midterm miracle period they rise, historically, 92% of the time, and in the period that follows that, they’re normally positive about 85% of the time, with slightly lower average returns of about 4 to 5% (compared to the midterm miracle’s 6.5%).

“Will that happen this time?” asks Fisher. “Well, you don’t really get the average except for by luck, but it’s probably a profitable time. It’s a good time, partly because people still remain skeptical. People keep coming up with yeah buts to try to justify why this can’t really be a bull market. And it is a bull market.”

With such a positive outlook, then, it makes sense to find out which stocks Fisher thinks are the ones that will keep on delivering the goods, and we’ve gotten the process started. We ran a pair of names Fisher remains heavily invested in through the TipRanks database to see if there’s widespread agreement on the Street that these are both worth leaning into right now. Turns out there certainly is – both are currently rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus. Let’s find out why.

Las Vegas Sands (LVS)

For our first Fisher-backed name, we’ll head to the hospitality and entertainment sector and Las Vegas Sands, a company known for its prestigious resort properties and casinos. Founded by the late billionaire entrepreneur Sheldon Adelson, the company played a pivotal role in shaping the Las Vegas Strip into a hub of luxury and extravagance. The company sold its Las Vegas properties in 2021, but its footprint is now global with properties in Macau and Singapore (Marina Bay Sands).

Story continues

The stock market has made a remarkable recovery this year and that has been mirrored by the big improvement made at LVS in 2023, as was evident in the company’s recent Q2 report. Revenue climbed by 142% year-over-year to $2.54 billion, beating the Street’s call by $160 million. Adj. EPS came in at $0.46, ahead of the forecasts by $0.03.

However, investors were a bit disappointed in the quarter’s Macau visitors, which reached around 6.7 million. That is roughly 68% of the 9.9 million visitors seen in 2Q19, the last comparable period before the Covid-19 pandemic impacted operations. That said, despite the post-earnings drop, the stock’s 23% year-to-date return is still better than the 19% gains delivered so far by the S&P 500.

Meanwhile, Fisher keeps hold of a big LVS position, being the owner of 9,242,005 shares, currently worth over $547 million.

The company also has a fan in Stifel analyst Steven Wieczynski, who is not bothered about the visitation numbers, and in fact, is impressed with the way things are shaping up for LVS.

“The recovery in Macau/Singapore continues to exceed our expectations,” said the 5-Star analyst after scanning the Q2 print. “Moving forward we expect to witness positive earnings revisions as the recovery and profitability in both markets is not fully embedded in current consensus, in our opinion. With fears continuing to swell around the domestic consumer, we believe owning LVS and their Macau-centric peers presents the best risk/reward setup for the remainder of 2023… LVS and other Macau-centric names remain momentum stocks and as long as visitation/spend patterns continue to be healthy over the next couple of months, we believe shares should outperform.”

Translating these thoughts into grades and numbers, Wieczynski’s Buy rating is accompanied by a $78 price target, suggesting the shares have room for growth of 31% in the year ahead. (To watch Wieczynski’s track record, click here)

Most on the Street agree. Based on 9 Buys vs. 2 Holds, the stock claims a Strong Buy consensus rating. Going by the $70.95 average target, a year from now, investors will be locking in returns of ~19%. (See LVS stock forecast)

Marvell Technology(MRVL)

Our next Fisher-backed name offers an entirely different value proposition. Marvell is a prominent semiconductor firm known for its innovative solutions and advancements in the field of data infrastructure. The Santa Clara, California-based company has established itself as a global leader in providing integrated circuits and storage solutions for a wide range of applications.

Its product portfolio includes a diverse array of offerings, such as data storage controllers, networking products and custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), while the company caters to diverse markets, including data centers, automotive, enterprise networking, cloud, and carrier infrastructure, among others.

Tech has driven the market gains this year, and MRVL shares have participated in the rally – the stock is up by 75% year-to-date. A big chunk of those gains came in the wake of the company’s first quarter of fiscal 2024 report (April quarter). While revenue fell by 9% y/y to $1.32 billion, that figure beat the consensus estimate by $20 million. Likewise on the bottom-line, adj. EPS of $0.31 edged out the $0.29 forecast. The outlook impressed, as well. For FQ2, at the midpoint, revenue is expected to reach $1.330 billion, compared to consensus at $1.31 billion, while adj. EPS is anticipated to hit $0.32 vs. the Street’s call of $0.31.

Fisher, then, must be pleased with his ongoing investment. He owns 1,356,647 MRVL shares, which currently boast a market value just over $88 million.

Assessing MRVL’s prospects, Wolfe analyst Chris Caso points out several reasons why investors should consider adding shares of this semi heavyweight to their portfolios.

“Our constructive thesis is underpinned by a return to normal in MRVL’s cyclical businesses (consumer, enterprise networking, wired carrier networking and storage – about half of CY24 revenue), coupled with MRVL’s structural growth businesses… We expect Inphi/optical to be the fastest growth business within MRVL due to the need to move to optical interconnect as hyperscale speeds move higher, and copper runs into physical limits… We view auto growth to be secure since MRVL has the only multi-Gb solution and automakers are clearly migrating to ethernet over time. Semi-custom growth is also likely with secure design wins (albeit at dilutive GMs, though accretive OMs),” the 5-Star analyst wrote.

These comments form the basis for Caso’s Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating while his $80 price target implies shares will climb 23% higher over the one-year timeframe. (To watch Caso’s track record, click here)

Elsewhere on the Street, one analyst remains unconvinced, but all 19 other recent reviews are also positive, making the consensus view here a Strong Buy. (See MRVL stock forecast)

Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. misses on earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.39 EPS, expectations were $0.4.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Keurig Dr Pepper's Earnings Call for the Second Quarter of 2023. This conference call is being recorded, and there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the call. I would now like to introduce Keurig Dr Pepper's Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Initiatives, Jane Gelfand. Ms. Gelfand, please go ahead.

Jane Gelfand: Thank you, and hello, everyone. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release detailing our second quarter results. Consistent with previous quarters, we will be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis, which reflects constant currency growth rates and excludes items affecting comparability. The company believes that the adjusted basis provides investors with additional insight into our business and operating performance trends. While the exclusion of items affecting comparability and the use of constant currency growth rates are not in accordance with GAAP, we believe that the adjusted basis provides meaningful comparisons and an appropriate basis for discussion of our performance. Details of the excluded items are provided in the reconciliation tables included in our press release and our 10-Q, which will be filed later today.

Due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of certain impacts outside of the company's control, we do not reconcile our guidance. We will also speak about the concept of underlying performance, which removes the impact of non-operational items in the current and prior years. These items include gains on asset sale leaseback transactions, reimbursement of litigation expenses related to the successful resolution of our BODYARMOR lawsuit, a business interruption insurance recovery and a change in accounting policy for stock compensation. Finally, our discussion this morning may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based upon subsequent events.

Story continues

A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC. Here with us today to discuss our results are KDP Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort; Chief Financial Officer, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi; and our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Maria Sceppaguercio. I'll now turn it over to Bob.

Robert Gamgort: Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. KDP’s second quarter once again demonstrated our portfolio’s resilience and ability to consistently deliver on our total company commitments. Our solid performance was driven by strength in U.S. refreshment beverages, encouraging developments in U.S. coffee and continued momentum in international. Consolidated Q2 results were healthy with strong revenue momentum and sequentially accelerating operating income and EPS growth. Net sales advanced more than 6% supported by net price realization, modest category elasticities and good share performance across much of our portfolio. For the first time since Q3 2021, reported gross margins expanded as an improving balance between pricing, inflation and productivity began to emerge.

Gross profit dollar growth funded marketing increases across all segments, and help to offset continued cost pressures in transportation, warehousing, and labor. As we forecasted, we're in the early stages of a margin recovery that we expect become more visible in the back half. Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we are raising our 2023 net sales growth outlook to 5% to 6%, while our full year EPS Outlook is optically unchanged, it in fact represents greater than originally anticipated underlying rule with an enhanced composition to our earnings profile. As Sudhanshu will discuss in more detail, we now expect minimal non-operational items in 2023 setting KDP up for strong and sustainable earnings base from which to grow in 2024 and beyond.

U.S. refreshment beverage’s performance in Q2 was outstanding double-digit revenue growth and strong operating margin expansion. Similar to last quarter, category growth and our own momentum remained pricing-le. Limited volume elasticities across the portfolio. Though demand is resilient, we are mindful of the various pressures facing our consumers, and are proactively meeting our needs to product, and package innovation along with strong in-market execution. These elements come together, we see market share gains. Q2 these were most notable across our CSDs sparkling water, coconut water and juice portfolios. Even as price realization begins to moderate in the back half, we remain confident in our ability to drive attractive organic growth by creating value among three key dimensions.

First, by driving growth in core brands through marketing and brand renovation. Second by filling portfolio white spaces via innovation and external partnerships; and third, by enhancing the effectiveness of our omni-channel selling and distribution system. We delivered on each of these dimensions in Q2. Focusing first on our core brands. For the second consecutive quarter, Dr. Pepper was the largest share gainer in the CSD category, bolstered by the success of Strawberries & Cream, and the continued strong momentum of Dr. Pepper Zero Sugar, which was once again maybe top two food and beverage product in IRI Circana’s New Product Pacesetter Innovation Ranking. Keurig also continue to outperform driven by its multicultural appeal and unsweetened sparkling waters, our partnership with Polar have now boosted the brand to the #2 volume share position nationally.

We also brought significant excitement or choose categories were mocked in a wine puncher driving innovation and gaining share. When it comes to the partnerships our C4 distribution transition is proceeding well. 2023 is a year of transition and investment and though it is still early days in our distribution rollout we are driving gains across multiple metrics and remain confident in the growth potential of C4. KDP distributed geographies, total points of distribution increased nearly 60% versus prior year and waited weeks on display across large format food outlets are up nearly 50% relative to the beginning of 2023. These gains translated into continued velocity and share momentum for C4, and accelerated the brand's already strong revenue growth even further.

Clearly, our partnership approach continues to create win-win outcomes, making this model increasingly attractive to other high potential companies including La Colombe, which I'll speak more about shortly. The effectiveness of our selling and distribution engine underpins our success across all the examples I cited. One would acknowledge the hard work our teams have done to drive improvement across the system where it shows signs of strain during the pandemic. Customer service levels have now significantly improved relative to where we were during the COVID period, and in some cases exceed pre-pandemic comparisons. But our work here is never complete. These strides are leading to even tighter in-store and on-shelf execution as our market share momentum demonstrates.

Turning now to US Coffee, we're exiting Q2, we saw several encouraging developments that are expected to benefit segment performance over the coming quarters. On our last earnings call I identified three key tenets underpinning our expectations in this segment. First, an at-home coffee category momentum would begin to recover in the back half, as mobility comparison ease. Second that we would add approximately two million new households to Keurig’s ecosystem in 2023, aided by BrewID & Pod innovation and the addition of new brands. And third, that segment operating margins would improve meaningfully in the back half supported by a better balance between pricing, inflation and productivity. We had even more visibility to these elements playing out today with Q2 marking an expected trough in both top-line growth and margins.

Let's address each point in turn. First, as anticipated, at home coffee category momentum began to improve toward the end of the second quarter. This continue to do so in July. Lot of time our consumers are spending at home this year versus last is continuing to normalize. Since we believe time spent at home is the single largest variable driving at home coffee consumption, it follows that volume trends are recovering too. We are observing this across broader at-home coffee within which single-serve continues to gain share. Category recovery is very clear when looking at publicly syndicated data. In Q1, Keurig compatible Pod volumes good proxy for the total single-serve category declined nearly 4% across measured channels. Q2 these declines moderated to less than 2% with improvement particularly notable towards the end of the quarter.

For the last four weeks, category volumes are flat to up slightly. Notably, category and KDP volume performance has been even stronger in non-track channels such as e-commerce and Unmeasured Club. Category trend is a positive leading indicator for our business and we would expect sequential improvement in net sales growth in the back half. That said, we are prepared for our volume growth to lag the single-serve category in the shorter term, as we focus on optimizing profitability. Pricing across all sub- segments of our K-Cup K- portfolio Is now more fully flowing through our financials including from our partner breadth consistent with our previous expectation that pricing would catch up to inflation, but a delay We also exited some of our lowest margin private-label contracts.

Both of these elements are now filtering through our results and the syndicated data. Longer-term, our growth in U.S. coffee will remain underpinned by driving incremental household penetration for the Keurig system and increasing revenues from our existing 38 million active households, which brings me to the second tenet of our coffee outlook, driving incremental household penetration. In Q2, we furthered this growth strategy by elevating our presence in cold coffee, which is an important trend among younger consumers. This spring, we nationally expanded the K-Iced Brewer platform, especially formulated Ice K-Cup pods. Strong marketing and activation activities across all media and digital channels, including a special limited edition Rolling Stone’s K-Iced brewer that sold out in less than 24 hours.

These Innovations are off to a very strong start with the K-Iced Brewer family performing extremely well and our ice pods proving highly incremental to our base business. Just last week, we announced a strategic partnership with La Colombe, super premium and award-winning coffee brand with wide appeal and untapped potential. Partnership which includes an equity investment, a sales and distribution agreement for RTD Coffee and a K-Cup pod licensing agreement is a compelling example of our ability to add value to a single partner across both hot and cold beverages, which KDP is uniquely positioned to deliver. Our collaboration with La Colombe will encompass several exciting strategic avenues. We will leverage our sales and distribution capabilities to scale La Colombe across major retail classes of trade.

Along with the Pete's brand, we're creating a ready to drink coffee platform, which will enable us to better serve the needs of our consumers and retail customers in this important category. We will also work closely with La Colombe to formulate and introduce the brand into the Keurig ecosystem in a K-Cup format. Here too, we are building a super premium platform as La Colombe joined several recently added brands like Intelligentsia, BLK & Bold, and Philz. Additionally, La Colombe is a vertically integrated model and specialized manufacturing knowledge are other differentiated elements that could enhance our collaboration over time. In short, this partnership has strong value creation potential that when unlocked will benefit both KDP and LA Colombe to our joint ownership model.

Now moving to the third element, driving our coffee outlook. We continue to expect segment margins for the U.S. coffee segment to meaningfully improve both sequentially and year-over-year in Q3 and Q4. Multiple factors led the segment margin contraction over the last few years and several elements including sequential favorability in pricing, commodity costs and productivity are now starting to come together to facilitate a margin rebuild. Pricing to offset cumulative inflation across our K-Cup portfolio including for partner and private-label brands will now more fully flow through starting in Q3. Commodity cost pressures including in green coffee and packaging are also projected to ease. Efficiency benefits should ramp up throughout the year as we have redoubled our productivity efforts following a period focus on mitigating supply chain disruptions.

We will work to further enhance these elements going forward with the expected back half margin inflection and important marker for future profit growth. Our International segment continues to perform well, even as it begins to lapse double-digit growth in the year ago period. In Q2, Canadian volume momentum was fueled by non-alcoholic and low alcohol beverages where we have multiple brands like Atypique and Labatt's is gaining share. This is an exciting set of emerging categories where we plan to leverage our learnings across markets. Execution also remains strong in our Canadian coffee business where KDP manufactured Pod’s grew consumption dollars in gained market share during the period. In Mexico, our DSD network continues to strengthen, which is supporting broad based share momentum across our LRB portfolio and the ongoing rollout of our partnership with Red Bull.

Across the portfolio, Pen UCL and its aide extensions into flavored sparkling waters, as well as our CSD brands continue to perform very well. Wrapping up, our consolidated Q2 results are yet another illustration of our modern beverage company working to deliver strong, consistent and predictable company performance. We continue to develop our business for the long term to investments in innovation, partnerships and capabilities, while demonstrating our ability to work through shorter-term normalization in coffee. We also continue to deploy our cash to create value for shareholders. It’s all this via the equity investment in La Colombe and through the opportunistic repurchase of KDP’s shares, which continued through Q2 as our share price remain dislocated.

We are raising our 2023 outlook for constant currency net sales growth, do 5% to 6% and reaffirming our guidance for adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 7% with an improving composition of our earnings profile. We now expect only minimal non-operational benefits within the frameworks of this guidance implying double-digit adjusted EPS growth on an underlying basis. I'll now turn it over to Sudhanshu to discuss Q2 results and our balance of year outlook in greater detail.

Sudhanshu Priyadarshi : Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our concentrated quarter two results which represented another quarter of strong sales growth with reported gross margin expansion both sequentially and year-over-year and significant reinvestment in marketing. Reported sales advanced 6.6%, to $3.8 billion with 6.1% organic growth, reflecting strong pricing and a modest decline in volume mix. Consolidated top-line momentum, was driven by U.S. refreshment beverages and international segments, partially offset by a trough quarter in U.S. coffee which we anticipated. Reported gross margin expanded slightly year-over-year to 54.8% as we made progress in offsetting ongoing inflection. This is an important change in trend past in the nearly two years.

Even with continued cost pressures across transportation, warehousing and labor, we reinvested significantly in marketing, with increases across each segment. As a result, total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 40 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating income grew 4.4%, and additional below the line leverage helped drive adjusted EPS of $0.42, 7.7% above prior year. We continued to deploy our cash in accordance with our evolved capital allocation priorities. Over the past four quarters, we have opportunistically repurchased nearly 22 million KDP shares, including 7 million shares in quarter two in recognition of a significant long-term opportunity in our stock. Combined with our quarterly dividend, we have returned approximately $1.9 billion of cash to shareholders over this timeframe.

In addition, since the merger, we have evolved our ownership structure to that of the modern beverage company we are today, increasing KDP’s public float from 13% in 2018 to 73% today. This includes the exit of Mondelēz which earlier this month completed its final sale of the long-term strategic equity stake it took as part of the KGM Tech private in 2016. During the quarter, we continued to persistently invest in promising partnership and M&A opportunities, namely the $300 million investment we made in La Colombe announced last week. KDP’s successful track record in the scaling beverage brands and strengthening our leadership positions across our key categories make us a sought-after partner for high potential companies and brand owners.

We remain discerning and disciplined at all such opportunities seeking out only those that has compelling the strategic merit create win-win outcomes for both parties and provide significant value creation potential. Turning now to segment performance. U.S. refreshment beverages sales grew an impressive 11.8%, led by 12 percentage points from pricing with virtually no volume mix impact. This resilient volume mix performance continue to reflect the strength of our portfolio, ongoing market share gains, manageable. category elasticities in the face of significant pricing and the contribution from C4 energy. Segment operating income increased 18.1% and segment margins expanded 150 basis points as pricing and productivity benefits more than offset commodity, manufacturing and labor inflation and an increase in marketing investments.

In US coffee, sales declined by 0.7%, with positive pricing more than offset by anticipated volume expression which I will further explain now. Focusing first on the consumable parts business, as Bob indicated, we are encouraged by the improving consumption volume trends in the single subcategory exiting the first half. We see this category trend as the leading indicator for the direction of our business. Further, in quarter two, our reported Pod shipment declines had yet to reflect any improvement due to three primary factors. First, a category volume recovery began later in the period and therefore had a limited impact on quarterly results. Second , we lapped a period last year when we were replenishing retailer and partner inventories after supplying to disruptions creating a difficult shipment compression; and third, our conjunction and shipment volume were impacted by our decision to exit some low value private-label contracts.

We expect some lingering impact to our shipment volume from factors two entry as we move into quarter three. Even so revenue trends are projected to sequentially strengthen driven by positive pricing and moderating volume declines. On a trailing 12 month basis, brewer shipments declined 11% year-over-year. For perspective, our brewer volume is still 18% higher than the comparable 12-month period ending quarter two 2019, which represents a clean pre-pandemic compression. The point here is that, despite all the volatility of the last several years, the surging demand during the height of COVID and the later stages of normalization we are working through, demand for Keurig ecosystem is greater today than it was four years ago among both consumers and retail partners.

Our Q2 brewer shipment declined 10.9%, a sequential improvement relative to quarter one and were impacted by the same factors we discussed last quarter. With improved softer discretionary demand for smaller appliances, including brewers which saw mid-single-digit consumption declines and additional, albeit moderating pressures from trade inventory rebalancing. After two quarters of inventory adjustments, we believe these are that largely behind us looking out to the back half. Importantly, Keurig branded brewers gained share of all of coffee makers sold in quarter two, which recently launched KI brewers seen good traction in the market. We will further support these new brewers and highly incremental ice bars in the back half as we continue to expand our cold coffee platform and offerings.

US coffee operating income contracted 14.6% at 30.1% segment margins were similar to quarter one level, but 310 basis points lower year-over-year. Versus the prior year, this performance reflected a continued unfavorable relationship between pricing and inflation, as well a significant investment in higher marketing in part to support our ice innovation launches. Looking to the back half of the year in U.S. coffee, we forecast a gradual recovery in revenue growth, coupled with significantly improved margins. This combination underpins our outlook or a strong rebound in segment, operating income with positive growth in quarter three to be followed by very attractive gains in quarter four. Our international segment performance in quarter two remains strong even as we lapped tougher years ago completions.

Net sales increased 10.9% on a reported basis with constant currency growth up 7%. Net price realization contributed 6.1% and volume mix was up 0.9% year-over-year. Segment operating income grew 11.5% on a reported basis and 7.7% in constant currency, reflecting the benefit of the growth in net sales and increase productivity, partially offset by inflationary pressures and a significant increase in marketing investment. Turning briefly to cash flow. Free cash flow totaled almost $300 million in the second quarter. As we enter the seasonally more cash generative back half, we would expect our absolute levels of free cash flow as well as free cash conversion to meaningfully improve from here. This brings me to our consolidated outlook for 2023, which we updated in our press release this morning.

Our outlook for constant currency net sales growth is now higher at 5% to 6% and we continue to expect adjusted EPS to grow 6% to 7%. While our EPS outlook is unchanged on the surface, expected profile of our earnings is now further improved relative to our guidance earlier this year. Specifically, you’ll recall that 2022 benefited from several non-operational items and at the start of this year we expected to reduce the use of these items by approximately 50% in 2023. I am pleased to share that our EPS forecast now includes only minimal such benefits. As a result, on an underlying basis, I our EPS growth is now projected to be in the double-digits versus our prior expectations for a high-single-digit gain. This very strong underlying performance demonstrates the earnings power inherent in KDP’s model.

It is also effectively and increase to our 2023 growth outlook and will preclude any further upside to EPS expectations for this year while setting us up for a strong and sustainable base from which KDP can grow earnings in 2024. Our full year guidance includes the following expectations for below the line items. Interest expense in a $470 million to $475 million range; equity method earnings from Nutrabolt of approximately $40 million to $45 million; an effective tax rate of 22% for the year and approximately $1.4 1 billion diluted, which is average shares outstanding. We have covered a lot of ground today. So I would just finish by remarking on the projected cadence of earnings for the balance of the year. Given the evolution of pricing, inflation and productivity, along with the timing of planned reinvestments over the back half, we expect only modest EPS growth in quarter three, followed by very strong results in quarter four.

With the good first half in the books and the enhanced visibility to the balance of the year, we are confident in our robust finish to 2023. With that, I will now turn the call back to Bob for closing comments. Robert Gamgort Thanks, Sudhanshu. If you haven't done so already, I encourage all of you to read our 2020 corporate responsibility report, which was published last month. Highlighted within its pages is the significant work KDP is doing to further our sustainability agenda. We're very proud of our progress across multiple focus areas including in renewable energy, water stewardship, and diversity and inclusion. To close, Q2 was a very good quarter for KDP across multiple dimensions. Performance in U.S. refreshment beverages was once again exceptional and international posted another great quarter.

US coffee is approaching an important inflection with improved visibility to a significant margin recovery, which we expect to lead to strong operating income growth as we close out this transitional year for the segment. On a consolidated basis our efforts to offset inflation are increasingly evident in gross margin stability, and marketing reinvestment across all segments. And as we discussed today, full year guidance implies double-digit underlying EPS growth with an even stronger top-line outlook. These are all key elements to set us up for ongoing momentum in the back half and ultimately into next year. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Keurig Dr Pepper's Earnings Call for the Second Quarter of 2023. This conference call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)
I would now like to introduce Keurig Dr Pepper's Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Initiatives, Jane Gelfand, Ms. Gelfand, please go ahead.

Jane Gelfand

Thank you, and hello, everyone. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release detailing our second quarter results. Consistent with previous quarters, we will be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis, which reflects constant currency growth rates and excludes items affecting comparability.
The company believes that the adjusted basis provides investors with additional insight into our business and operating performance trends. While the exclusion of items affecting comparability and the use of constant currency growth rates are not in accordance with GAAP, we believe that the adjusted basis provides meaningful comparisons and an appropriate basis for discussion of our performance.
Details of the excluded items are provided in the reconciliation tables included in our press release and our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of certain impacts outside of the company's control, we do not reconcile our guidance.
We will also speak about the concept of underlying performance, which removes the impact of nonoperational items in the current and prior years. These items include gains on asset sale-leaseback transactions, reimbursement of litigation expenses related to the successful resolution of our BodyArmor lawsuit, a business interruption insurance recovery and a change in accounting policy for stock compensation.
Finally, our discussion this morning may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based upon subsequent events. A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC.
Here with us today to discuss our results are KDP Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort; Chief Financial Officer, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi; and our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Maria Sceppaguercio.
I'll now turn it over to Bob.

Robert J. Gamgort

Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone.
KDP second quarter once again demonstrated our portfolio's resilience and ability to consistently deliver on our total company commitments. Our solid performance was driven by strength in U.S. refreshment beverages, encouraging developments in U.S. Coffee and continued momentum in international.
Consolidated Q2 results were healthy, with strong revenue momentum and sequentially accelerating operating income and EPS growth. Net sales advanced more than 6%, supported by net price realization, modest category elasticities and good share performance across much of our portfolio.
For the first time since Q3 2021, reported gross margins expanded as an improving balance between pricing, inflation and productivity began to emerge. Gross profit dollar growth funded marketing increases across all segments and helped to offset continued cost pressures in transportation, warehousing and labor.
As we forecasted, we are in the early stages of a margin recovery that we expect to become more visible in the back half. Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we are raising our 2023 net sales growth outlook to 5% to 6%. While our full year EPS outlook is optically unchanged, it in fact represents greater than originally anticipated underlying growth with an enhanced composition to our earnings profile.
And Sudhanshu will discuss in more detail, we now expect minimal nonoperational items in 2023, setting KDP up for strong and sustainable earnings base from which to grow in 2024 and beyond. U.S. refreshment beverages performance in Q2 was outstanding, double-digit revenue growth and strong operating margin expansion.
Similar to last quarter, category growth and our own momentum remained pricing led. Limited volume elasticities across the portfolio. Though demand is resilient, we are mindful of the various pressures facing our consumers, and are proactively meeting their needs through product and package innovation along with strong in-market execution. When these elements come together, we see market share gains.
Q2, these were most notable across our CSDs, sparkling water, coconut water and juice portfolio. Even as price realization begins to moderate in the back half, we remain confident in our ability to drive attractive organic growth by creating value among 3 key dimensions.
First, by driving growth in core brands through marketing and brand renovation. Second, by filling portfolio white spaces via innovation and external partnerships. And third, by enhancing the effectiveness of our omnichannel selling and distribution system. We delivered on each of these dimensions in Q2.
Focusing first on our core brands. For the second consecutive quarter, Dr Pepper was the largest share gainer in the CSD category, bolstered by the success of Strawberries & Cream and the continued strong momentum of Dr Pepper Zero Sugar, which was once again named a top 2 food and beverage product in IRi-Circana's new product pacesetter innovation rankings.
Keurig also continue to outperform driven by its multicultural appeal. In unsweetened sparkling waters, our partnership with Polar has now boosted the brand to the #2 volume share position nationally. We also brought significant excitement to our juice categories where Mott’s and Hawaiian Punch are driving innovation and gaining share.
When it comes to partnerships, our C4 distribution transition is proceeding well. 2023 is a year of transition and investment and though it is still early days in our distribution rollout, we are driving gains across multiple metrics and remain confident in the growth potential of C4.
In KDP distributed geographies, total points of distribution increased nearly 60% versus prior year, and weighted weeks on display across large format food outlets are up nearly 15% relative to the beginning of 2023. These gains translated into continued velocity and share momentum for C4 and accelerated the brand's already strong revenue growth even further.
Clearly, our partnership approach continues to create win-win outcomes, making this model increasingly attractive to other high-potential companies including La Colombe, which I'll speak more about shortly.
The effectiveness of our selling and distribution engine underpins our success across all the examples I cited. I want to acknowledge the hard work our teams have done to drive improvement across the system, where it showed signs of strain during the pandemic.
Customer service levels are now significantly improved relative to where we were during the COVID period, and in some cases, exceed pre-pandemic comparisons. Though our work here is never complete, these strides are leading to even tighter in-store and on-shelf execution as our market share momentum demonstrates.
Turning now to U.S. Coffee, we're exiting Q2, we saw several encouraging developments that are expected to benefit segment performance over the coming quarters. On our last earnings call, I identified 3 key tenets underpinning our expectations in this segment.
First, that at-home coffee category momentum would begin to recover in the back half as mobility comparisons ease. Second, that we would add approximately 2 million new households to the Keurig's ecosystem in 2023, aided by brewer and pot innovation and the addition of new brands.
And third, that segment operating margins would improve meaningfully in the back half, supported by a better balance between pricing, inflation and productivity. We have even more visibility to these elements playing out today with Q2 marking an expected trough in both top line growth and margins.
Let's address each point in turn. First, as anticipated, at-home coffee category momentum began to improve towards the end of the second quarter and has continued to do so in July. Amount of time our consumers are spending at home this year versus last is continuing to normalize. Since we believe time spent at home is the single largest variable driving at-home coffee consumption, it follows that volume trends are recovering too.
We are observing this across broader at-home coffee within which single-serve continues to gain share. Category recovery is very clear when looking at publicly syndicated data. In Q1, Keurig compatible pod volumes, good proxy for the total single-serve category, declined nearly 4% across measured channels.
Q2, these declines moderated to less than 2%, with improvement particularly notable towards the end of the quarter. For the last 4 weeks, category volumes are flat to up slightly. Notably, category and KDP volume performance has been even stronger in nontrack channels, such as e-commerce and unmeasured club.
Category trend is a positive leading indicator for our business, and we would expect sequential improvement in net sales growth in the back half. That said, we are prepared for our volume growth to lag the single-serve category in the shorter term as we focus on optimizing profitability.
Pricing across all subsegments of our K-Cup portfolio is now more fully flowing through our financials, including from our partner brands, consistent with our previous expectation that pricing would catch-up to inflation, but at a delay.
We also exited some of our lowest margin private label contracts. Both of these elements are now filtering through our results and the syndicated data. Longer term, our growth in U.S. Coffee will remain underpinned by driving incremental household penetration for the Keurig system and increasing revenues from our existing 38 million active households, which brings me to the second tenet of our coffee outlook, driving incremental household penetration.
In Q2, we furthered this growth strategy by elevating our presence in cold coffee, which is an important trend among younger consumers. This spring, we nationally expanded the K-Iced Brewer platform and specially formulated iced K-Cup pods, strong marketing and activation activities across all media and digital channels, including a special limited edition Rolling Stones, K-Iced Brewer that sold out in less than 24 hours.
These innovations are off to a very strong start with the K-Iced Brewer family performing extremely well and our iced pods proving highly incremental to our base business. Just last week, we announced a strategic partnership with La Colombe, super premium and award-winning coffee brand with wide appeal and untapped potential.
Partnership, which includes an equity investment, a sales and distribution agreement for RTD coffee and a K-Cup pod licensing agreement is a compelling example of our ability to add value to a single partner across both hot and cold beverages, which KDP is uniquely positioned to deliver. 
Our collaboration with La Colombe will encompass several exciting strategic avenues. We will leverage our sales and distribution capability to scale La Colombe across major retail classes of trade. Along with the Philz brand, we are creating a ready-to-drink coffee platform, which will enable us to better serve the needs of our consumers and retail customers in this important category.
We will also work closely with La Colombe to formulate and introduce the brand into the Keurig ecosystem in a K-Cup format. Here too, we are building a super-premium platform as La Colombe joined several recently added brands like Intelligentsia, BLK & Bold and Philz.
Additionally, La Colomben is vertically integrated model and specialized manufacturing knowledge are other differentiated elements that could enhance our collaboration over time. In short, this partnership has strong value creation potential that when unlocked will benefit both KDP and La Colombe through our joint ownership model.
Now moving to the third element driving our coffee outlook. We continue to expect segment margins for the U.S. Coffee segment to meaningfully improve both sequentially and year-over-year in Q3 and Q4. Multiple factors led to segment margin contraction over the last 2 years and several elements, including sequential favorability in pricing, commodity costs and productivity are now starting to come together to facilitate a margin rebuild. 
Pricing to offset cumulative inflation across our K-Cup portfolio, including for partner and private label brands, will now (inaudible) fully flow through starting in Q3. Commodity cost pressures including in green coffee and packaging are also projected to ease.
Efficiency benefits should ramp up throughout the year as we have redoubled our productivity efforts following a period focus on mitigating supply chain disruptions. We will work to further enhance these elements going forward with the expected back half margin inflection, an important marker for future profit growth.
Our International segment continues to perform well, even as it begins to lap double-digit growth in the year ago period. Q2 Canadian volume momentum was fueled by nonalcoholic and low alcohol beverages, where we have multiple brands like Philz and with that gaining share. This is an exciting set of emerging categories where we plan to leverage our learnings across markets.
Execution also remained strong in our Canadian Coffee business, where KDP manufactured pods grew consumption dollars and gained market share during the period. Mexico, our DSD network, continues to strengthen, which is supporting broad-based share momentum across our LRB portfolio and the ongoing rollout of our partnership with Red Bull.
Across the portfolio, Penafiel and its aid extensions into flavored sparkling waters as well as our CSD brands continue to perform very well.
Wrapping up our consolidated Q2 results are yet another illustration of our modern beverage company working to deliver strong, consistent and predictable company performance. We continue to develop our business for the long-term through investments in innovation, partnerships and capabilities, while demonstrating our ability to work through shorter-term normalization in coffee.
We also continue to deploy our cash to create value for shareholders. We saw this via the equity investment in La Colombe and through the opportunistic repurchase of KDP shares, which continued through Q2 as our share price remained dislocated.
We are raising our 2023 outlook for constant currency net sales growth to 5% to 6% and reaffirming our guidance for adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 7%, with an improving composition of our earnings profile. We now expect only minimal nonoperational benefits within the framework of this guidance implying double-digit adjusted EPS growth on an underlying basis.
I'll now turn it over to Sudhanshu to discuss Q2 results and our balance of year outlook in greater detail.

Sudhanshu Shekhar Priyadarshi

Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our consolidated quarter 2 results, which represented another quarter of strong sales growth, with reported gross margin expansion both sequentially and year-over-year and significant reinvestment in marketing.
Reported sales advanced 6.6% to $3.8 billion with 6.1% organic growth, reflecting strong pricing and a modest decline in volume/mix. Consolidated top line momentum was driven by U.S. Refreshment Beverages and International segments, partially offset by a trough quarter in U.S. Coffee, which we anticipated.
Reported gross margin expanded slightly year-over-year to 54.8% as we made progress in offsetting ongoing inflation. This is an important change in trend after nearly 2 years. Even with continued cost pressures across transportation, warehousing and labor, we reinvested significantly in marketing with increases across each segment.
As a result, total SG&A and the percentage of sales deleveraged 40 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating income grew 4.4% and additional below-the-line leverage helped drive adjusted EPS of $0.42, 7.7% above prior year.
We continue to deploy our cash in accordance with our evolved capital allocation priorities. Over the past 4 quarters, we have opportunistically repurchased nearly 22 million KDP shares, including 7 million shares in quarter 2, in recognition of a significant long-term opportunity in our stock. Combined with our quarterly dividend, we have returned approximately $1.9 billion of cash to shareholders over this timeframe.
In addition, since the merger, we have evolved our ownership structure to that of the modern beverage company we are today, increasing KDP's public float from 13% in 2018 to 73% today. This includes the exit of Mondelez, which earlier this month completed its final sale of the long-term strategic equity stake it took as part of the KGM Tech Private in 2016.
During the quarter, we continued to strategically invest in promising partnership and M&A opportunities namely the $300 million investment we made in La Colombe announced last week. KDP's successful track record in scaling beverage bands and strengthening our leadership positions across our key categories make us a sought-after partner for high potential companies and brand owners.
We remain discerning and disciplined around such opportunities, seeking out only those that has compelling strategic merit, create win-win outcomes for both parties and provide significant value creation potential.
Turning now to segment performance. U.S. Refreshment Beverages sales grew an impressive 11.8% led by 12 percentage points from pricing with virtually no volume/mix impact. This resilient volume/mix performance continued to reflect the strength of our portfolio, ongoing market share gains, manageable category elasticities in the face of significant pricing and the contribution from C4 Energy.
Segment operating income increased 18.1% and segment margins expanded 150 basis points, as pricing and productivity benefits more than offset commodity, manufacturing and labor inflation and an increase in marketing investment. In U.S. Coffee, sales declined 5.7% with positive pricing more than offset by anticipated volume/mix pressure, which I will further explain now.
Focusing first on the consumable pods business. As Bob indicated, we are encouraged by the improving consumption volume trends in the single-serve subcategory exiting the first half. We see this category trend as the leading indicator for the direction of our business.
However, in quarter 2, our reported pod shipment declines had yet to reflect any improvement due to 3 primary factors: first, a category volume recovery began later in the period, and therefore, had a limited impact on quarterly results; second, we lapped a period last year when we were replenishing retailer and partnered inventories after supply chain disruptions, creating a difficult shipment completion; and third, our conjunction and shipment volumes were impacted by our decision to exit some low-value private label contracts.
We expect some lingering impact to our shipment volume from factors II and III as we move into quarter 3. Even so, revenue trends are projected to sequentially strengthen, driven by positive pricing and moderating volume declines.
On a trailing 12-month basis, brewer shipments declined 11% year-over-year. For perspective, our brewer volume is still 18% higher than the comparable 12-month period ending quarter 2, 2019, which represents a clean pre-pandemic compression.
The point here is that despite all the volatility of the last several years, surging demand during the height of COVID and the later stages of normalization we are working through, demand for Keurig ecosystem is greater today than it was 4 years ago among both consumers and retail partners.
Our Q2 brewer shipment declined 10.9%, a sequential improvement relative to quarter 1 and were impacted by the same factors we discussed last quarter. These include softer discretionary demand for smaller appliances including brewers, which saw mid-single-digit consumption declines and additional a bit moderating pressures from trade inventory rebalancing.
After 2 quarters of inventory adjustments, we believe these are largely behind us, looking out to the back half. Importantly, Keurig branded brewers, gained share of all coffeemakers sold in quarter 2, with recently launched K-Iced brewer seeing good traction in the market.
We will further support these new brewers and highly incremental ice pods in the back half, as we continue to expand our cold coffee platform and offerings. U.S. Coffee operating income contracted 14.6% at 30.1% segment margins were similar to quarter 1 level, but 310 basis points lower year-over-year.
Versus the prior year, this performance reflected a continued unfavorable relationship between pricing and inflation as well as a significant investment in higher marketing in part support our Ice innovation launches.
Looking to the back half of the year in U.S. Coffee, we forecast a gradual recovery in revenue growth coupled with significantly improved margins. This combination underpins our outlook for a strong rebound in the segment operating income with positive growth in quarter 3 to be followed by very attractive gains in quarter 4.
Our International segment performance in quarter 2 remained strong, even as we lapped tougher year ago comparisons. Net sales increased 10.9% on a reported basis with constant currency growth of 7%. Net price realization contributed 6.1% and volume/mix was up 0.9% year-over-year.
Segment operating income grew 11.5% on a reported basis and 7.7% in constant currency, reflecting the benefit of the growth in net sales and increased productivity, partially offset by inflationary pressures and a significant increase in marketing investment.
Turning briefly to cash flow. Free cash flow totaled almost $300 million in the second quarter. As we enter the seasonally more cash-generative back half, we would expect our absolute levels of free cash flow as well as free cash conversion to meaningfully improve from here.
This brings me to our consolidated outlook for 2023, which we updated in our press release this morning. Our outlook for constant currency net sales growth is now higher at 5% to 6%, and we continue to expect adjusted EPS to grow 6% to 7%.
While our EPS outlook is unchanged on the surface, expected profile of our earnings is now further improved relative to our guidance earlier this year. Specifically, you will recall that 2022 benefited from several nonoperational items. And at the start of this year, we expected to reduce the use of these items by approximately 50% in 2023.
I am pleased to share that our EPS forecast now includes only minimal such benefits. As a result, on an underlying basis, our EPS growth is now projected to be in the double digits versus our prior expectations for a high single-digit gain. This very strong underlying performance demonstrates the earnings power inherent in KDP's model.
It is also effectively an increase to our 2023 growth outlook and will preclude any further upside to EPS expectations for this year, while setting us up for a strong and sustainable base from which KDP can grow earnings in 2024.
Our full year guidance includes the following expectations for below-the-line items. Interest expense in a $470 million to $475 million range. Equity method earnings from Nutrabolt of approximately $40 million to $45 million. An effective tax rate of 22% for the year, and approximately 1.41 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
We have covered a lot of ground today, so I will just finish by remarking on the projected savings of earnings for the balance of the year. Given the evolution of pricing, inflation and productivity, along with the timing of planned reinvestments over the back half, we expect only modest EPS growth in quarter 3 followed by very strong results in quarter 4. With a good first half in the books and the enhanced visibility to the balance of the year, we are confident in a robust finish to 2023.
With that, I will now turn the call back to Bob for closing comments.

Robert J. Gamgort

Thanks, Sudhanshu. If you haven't done so already, I encourage all of you to read our 2022 Corporate Responsibility report, which was published last month. Highlighted within its pages is the significant work KDP is doing to further our sustainability agenda. We're very proud of our progress across multiple focus areas, including in renewable energy, water stewardship and diversity and inclusion.
To close, Q2 was a very good quarter for KDP across multiple dimensions. Performance in U.S. Refreshment Beverages was once again exceptional and International posted another great quarter. U.S. Coffee is approaching an important inflection with improved visibility to a significant margin recovery, which we expect to lead the strong operating income growth as we close out this transitional year for the segment.
On a consolidated basis, our efforts to offset inflation are increasingly evident in gross margin stability and marketing reinvestment across all segments. And as we discussed today, full year guidance implies double-digit underlying EPS growth with an even stronger top line outlook. These are all key elements that set us up for ongoing momentum in the back half, and ultimately, into next year.
I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.

Question and Answer Session

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.

Christopher Michael Carey

So clearly, a solid result on a total company level, but at the same time, so much of the debate has been around coffee. And I think there's been a bit of a misunderstanding that the underlying assumption of the category has actually been improving through the year. And I think what I hear today is that, that improvement has continued to accelerate through the quarter and into the quarter-to-date.
And so I just have a couple of specific questions around that. So first, why do you think that underlying improvement has been occurring? And really, I'm trying to get from the concept of sustainability. Is it as simple as the away-from-home channel was recovering in the front half of the year, that's normalized and now the at-home channel has normalized as well?
And secondly, it sounds like you expect to remain below consumption in coffee into the second half of the year. Is that a pod and brewer comment? And just given the tough comps and you're making some changes to the portfolio, would you expect that dynamic to carry into 2024 or is this predominantly Q3 eases Q4, and then you've normalized from there?
So thanks for any perspective on just underlying durability of this improvement we've seen in the at-home coffee channel and also this dynamic of shipping to consumption and when you think you can start to close that gap over the next 2 to 4 quarters?

Robert J. Gamgort

Okay, Chris. Let me start at a very high level with the total category because I think that is most important. We've clearly weathered a storm over the past year-or-so that's impacted our category and our profitability within there. The negative impacts were on at-home coffee, we saw this category decline all forms globally.
And to answer your question, we have seen that as primarily driven by mobility changes. This is the post-COVID recovery mobility impact. That's largely played out, I think, by the end of the third quarter, for sure, that will be played out.
We also had some issues in terms of supply chain recovery coming out of COVID, where it was a service-at-all-cost mindset, and we were also not focused on productivity. And of course, inflation, and that was combined with a lag in our pricing realization. And that's -- when you add that all up, that's quite a list of challenges in our coffee business over the past year.
If you look at what the setup is right now, it's much more constructive. We're seeing a rebounding category, and that's largely driven by normalized mobility. To your specific question about away-from-home versus at-home. Away-from-home hasn't changed that much, right? If you look at office occupancy, it's pretty stable. It's improving very, very gradually over time, if that improves then we'll get the benefit from that on our away-from-home coffee business, but that's not something that we're banking on. It's really been an at-home coffee consumption story driven by changes in mobility.
So we're seeing this rebounding category. As we talked about in our prepared remarks, we're seeing that pricing, that we talked about that was lagged, now flowing through the P&L and of course, we're seeing a moderation in inflation. And the combination of that is very constructive going forward. The one thing I would point out is that single-serve coffee has and continues to gain share of all forms of coffee over this time period.
In terms of are shipments below consumption? The best way to look at us over the long-term, I'm not going to talk about 2024 specifically, but our shipments should approximate category consumption over time. Our focus is on category growth. We have about an 80% share of all pods that go through the system. Mix can change over time. But again, we're focused on category.
And I think you ought to just think about category rebound as being consistent with how we think about our long-term shipment trends. But in the short term, we're looking out against the period a year ago, we were still rebuilding shipments from supply chain disruption. So that's part of it.
We've also talked about exiting some of the lowest margin private label contracts, and then we've taken some additional pricing on our owned and license. We think these are really the right decisions to prioritize margin recovery in a recovering category.
And that's what's caused a little bit of a separation between consumption and shipments in the short-term. But there's no reason to think that's the case over the long term. And really, I would point you to category consumption as the long-term indicator.

Our next question will come from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.

Bryan Douglass Spillane

So just 2 quick ones for me. Sudhanshu, just the flip of nonoperational gains now not contributing as much, that's obviously good news. Is that a change in just the way you're going to treat them; one, backing them out versus including, or have things changed? So some of these financial moves like sale leasebacks, just not as attractive anymore?
And then the second one for you, Bob, is just 2 million household penetration or new households, is 2 million new households in coffee brewers still a possibility this year? Or might that be a little bit below that just given the current environment?

Sudhanshu Shekhar Priyadarshi

So Bob, let me take the first one. So Bryan, no, as we have said beginning of the year, KDP is focused on delivering best-in-class CPG performance. This also includes our enhancing of composition of our earnings profile. Last year, we had a lot of nonoperating items. When we started the year, we targeted a 50% reduction, but as you can see from our first half performance, our underlying business performance is great.
We are also seeing the margin recovery in coffee in second half, so we have enhanced visibility. So we believe that now we will have a minimal nonoperating and we will deliver a better underlying operating performance this year.
This will also help us in 2024 because we will not have this roughly 50% of headwind from last year, it was roughly -- I think it was more than $150 million, $160 million. We had a -- half of that was this year. We don't expect that to do that, and that will help us in 2024 and beyond. So there's no change. It's just our strong operating performance that we planned all along.

Robert J. Gamgort

Bryan, on the 2 million households, yes, still our target for 2023. As we've talked about a number of times, the brewer sales are really a great predictor of household penetration. So the 2 million is still where we're trending, though one thing I would point out is, as you know, that we are heavily fourth quarter loaded, holiday season, gifting, we've done well in difficult environments -- that difficult economic environments around that gifting because people go for more functional gifts during that time period.
Our innovation pipeline, the promotions, the retailer support that we're getting for the fourth quarter all looks terrific. But I've got a lot of game left to be played in the fourth quarter, but as we sit here today, we are targeting 2 million.

Our next question will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.

Dara Warren Mohsenian

So on the coffee side, you were very clear and comprehensive in your remarks on the second half improvement and what drives the improvement versus the first half. But in theory, it's a pretty big dichotomy.
So yes, I guess it'd just be helpful to hear how much of visibility you think you have at this point in coffee, particularly relative to some of the first half disappointment? Maybe rank order, some of the factors you mentioned in terms of driving that sequential improvement.
But also just longer term, broader context for the volatility we're seeing this year and what you think it sort of means for future growth prospects as we look out longer term? And then b, I'm sure coffee will get a lot of the airtime as usual, but we'd probably be remiss if we didn't touch on a U.S. Refreshment and International strength in the first half of the year. How sustainable do you think are the factors there that have driven the strength as you think about go-forward trends from here?

Robert J. Gamgort

Okay. I'll take both of these. I think it's always helpful and I feel like I remind everybody this on many of our calls, but I do think it's helpful to step back and look at the coffee category over the longer term. That gives you the best context. There's always short-term volatility, particularly in the COVID and post-COVID world.
But if you go back and it's in our press release, if you go back and you take a look at pre-COVID 2019 to our latest period, the CAGR on pods is mid-single digits; CAGR on brewers, it's about mid-single digits. And so there is a lot of bumpiness and it's been tough for all of you to navigate through the pluses and minuses over the past couple of years, but that context is always helpful, and it always serves us really well to look at the longer-term trends, which is, this is a growing category, driven by consumers converting from brewing by the pod to brewing by the cup.
We are the drivers of that. Our partners benefit from that, our retailers benefit from that, so does Keurig because we participate in 80% of those transactions. So that's -- the most important thing for everyone to always take away when you look at any quarterly results of the business.
In terms of the back half of the year and visibility is a really good question. The area that's been most challenging for us over the past couple of years is predicting consumer mobility. And it's not a concept we even thought about prior to COVID.
So be able to match up consumer mobility against in-home coffee consumption, we had to learn a lot there. And then also being able to predict it is really a difficult thing to do given the economists are having a tough time doing that. But I think that noise is largely behind us, which is the most important takeaway from this conversation, and we should see a normalization in category growth as behavior from a consumer perspective also normalizes.
The one area where we have had and still have the most visibility to is our margin. And I know that's been another area where there was pressure on the business. And as we explained, as we look forward, we understand coffee pricing in advance, we understand our pricing. And we also knew that the agreements that we had with our partners and our private label partners as well is that we have the ability to recover inflation, but it had a lag effect to it.
And there's only so much that you can talk about before you want to see the proof. And you're seeing the proof of that now flow through and we have great visibility to that in the back half of the year. So put it on the table, our assumptions for the back half of the year is continued slow and gradual recovery of the category in total.
We have and continued to gain share of total at-home coffee a single-serve, and then an improving margin, and that's driven by pricing flowing through the P&L, moderation and inflation, and our ability to focus on productivity now that our supply chain is in really good shape across the board. Our customer service on coffee has been fantastic.
So let me talk a little bit about Refreshment Beverages. It is a fantastic story that I'm glad you raised because we certainly don't take it for granted nor should anyone else. What's been working for us is 3 factors. We've been gaining share in a growing category, and I don't mean to make light of it because it's really -- each one of these is an important double-click, but it's driven by marketing, innovation and really importantly outstanding retail execution.
So gaining share in a growing category is always a positive thing. Our pricing and productivity have been catching up to inflation. There was -- we were chasing inflation for a long period of time, and we're able to narrow that gap. And I think importantly, consumer resilience has allowed the category to withstand all the pricing that was required to offset that inflation.
Now last point is an area that we continue to watch very carefully. We're seeing, in general, elasticities hold up nicely, but we're seeing some greater elasticities in some of the segments within LRB that we will watch and adjust to.
But if I were to summarize the cold beverage business, growing margin and share in a growing category is certainly a formula for success. We plan to continue to do everything I just said, plus add new partnerships as we've done with C4 most recently and then more recently, La Colombe.

Our next question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.

Andrea Faria Teixeira

I have a clarification to Sudhanshu's point on flat EPS, and then a question to Bob on the pod.
First, on the flat EPS growth outlook for Q3. What would be the underlying growth ex operational items for the quarter? Because we understand there were no operational items in Q3 last year?
And the question for Bob on the pods would be the shipment inflection. Should we expect shipments to converge to consumption in Q4, or kind of like embedding, well, the outlook that you gave for the fourth quarter? Or could you bridge the impact of the private label exit, which is one of the factors that was a headwind in the quarter and also in the second half?
And sorry for a 2-parted question. But on the pricing improved mix as you exit this third-party manufacturing, should we -- not third-party manufacturing, the private label, should we expect pricing to lap in Q3, or you expect to still have some benefit on pricing for pods into the second half of the year?

Sudhanshu Shekhar Priyadarshi

So let me take the first one. First, I would urge you to think about back half in total with the cadence between Q3 and Q4 EPS, just a matter of phasing. Our second half growth is expected to be largely Q4 loaded, reflecting the expected flow of investment spend and the cadence of pricing and productivity relative to inflation.
In forecasting quarter 3 EPS, last year, we had no nonoperating items in Q3. We had in Q4, which we expect that to be minimal. But the reason it's modestly higher year-over-year, there are 3 key components. One is U.S. Refreshment Beverages, we are lapping the year-ago pricing, and we are forecasting heavier investments.
U.S. Coffee, positive OI growth as margins begin to inflect in quarter 3 and then more to come in quarter 4. So those are the 2 main reasons mostly driven by our decision to invest more in quarter 3, but I said, let's look at the second half, and you will see that we'll have a strong EPS growth.

Robert J. Gamgort

Yes. I mean I'll reiterate what I said before, which is over the long-term consumption should equal shipments. There's no reason believe it would be different as is often the case, you see some separation between the 2 on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Clearly, it was time period, we had supply chain issues in which we were under shipping than we were over shipping to catch up on that.
What's happening right now in the back half of the year is exactly what we said is we're seeing on a consumption basis, a slow and gradual recovery. in the total at-home coffee category, single-serve continues to gain share of at-home coffee occasions, which is important. And then there's 2 things that are -- a couple of things, I should say, that are unique to us that's causing our shipments to be slightly behind consumption.
One is how we're lapping some of the year ago timing of shipments due to recovery. We talked about owned license pricing, and we also talked about some private label contracts that we exited all in the direction of making sure that we're rebuilding margins. And that will play out. So we had talked previously about, for the year, coffee being about up 1% in revenue and 3% to 4% in OI.
If I look at the way things are playing out and it's hard to forecast it differently, we've got great visibility to margins, so we expect that to strongly inflect in the second half, and that's going to lead to accelerated OI growth. I'll talk about that in a moment.
I think the revenue number may come in somewhat below that on a reported basis. I don't think it's that big of a deal. But the other thing to think about though, on the OI growth projection, even if that comes in slightly below that on a reported basis, per Sudhanshu comments, the -- without any nonoperational impacts, the adjusted segment on an underlying basis is even stronger than we talked about before.
So you add it all up and you'd say the back half of the year, there may be some puts and takes here, but the underlying strength of the business is really improving. And anything that's off any of these projections is really driven by some intentional strategies we put in place.
And then the last thing I would talk about on coffee margin is, there are 4 drivers of that margin, which is pricing, inflation, productivity and mix. And clearly, we're seeing the pricing flow through. You asked about in the second half versus the first half.
We had virtually no pricing coming through from partners and private label in the first half, that's just starting to flow through in the back half of the year, and that will ramp up. And yes, there are some trade-offs in mix and some of the other parts on here, but we have good visibility to improving margin going forward.

Operator

Our next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.

Lauren Rae Lieberman

Great. I was hoping we could maybe take a step back and do something a bit educational on coffee. So in the Nielsen data, I know you guys are oriented toward IRi, but in the Nielsen data, you can see that owned and licensed brands within pods have been losing share. And I think that's garnered quite a bit of attention from the investment community.
So I was hoping you could talk about -- I know that you've said historically, you managed the margin profile of owned and licensed to be comparable to that partner. But I was curious, if you could talk about why we should or shouldn't worry about that from a dollar profit contribution over time, and how you manage sort of the -- let's call it, the potential conflict of interest with partners versus what's owned in terms of market share and so on and how you manage that relationship?
Also, just Bob, you had mentioned pricing on owned and licensed, and I just wanted to be clear if that was new pricing that's recently gone in the market or if that's still to come?
And then finally, I know that inventory destocking for pods at retail had been a potential watch point that hasn't come up, so assuming it's a nonissue, but I just wanted to check in on that front as well?

Robert J. Gamgort

Sure. Yes, thanks for the opportunity for me to talk about the way the system works.
So again, I go back to the very beginning and say that we manage as an ecosystem that involves our brands, our partner brands and private label brands or retailer brands. And it's really important that retailers are considered to be a partner in this whole ecosystem as well because conversion of brewing by the pod by the cup benefits all of the interested stakeholders in this.
Our objective is really focused and hasn't changed, which is we want to have a growing system. We want the category to continue to expand. We want the dynamics of that category to be constructive for everybody.
Part of that is managing our own brands, which we manage very separately from our partners. So there is no conflict of interest. We manage those as a separate group within our organization that has no visibility into what our partners are private label are doing. And it allows us just to maintain focus on the category.
For us, we see the opportunity for more pricing within our brands within the category. If you take a look at our price gaps versus other forms of coffee, even though there's been pricing in the single-serve segment, the price gap versus all forms of at-home coffee right now are the narrowest they have ever been. And in fact, we believe they're at a point where it's actually not doing anything to drive category growth.
Partners, and that includes some of our retail partners in their private label brands, look, sometimes they have short-term objectives that are more share-driven. So we see some of that promotional competition and that shift share between one brand to another, but it really does nothing for the category, which is our focus.
And so that's why when I take a look at our pricing, it comes back from being more restrained in the promotional environment, which allows us to protect margin. And again, if you go back to the highest level, the rational decision for us to make is to improve our margins in a growing category.
And then you do point out something about if owned and licensed brands are losing some share, it might have some negative mix impact. Fair enough, that mix isn't as great as some people think it is, as we've said before. But I would then also point out that we're looking at pricing inflation and productivity. And the reason that people should believe that we're not concerned about that difference in share is the visibility that we're giving you to improving margin going forward.
If it were a heavy negative impact on our business, we wouldn't be able to do that. So we understand all of these levers of pricing inflation, productivity and mix. And sometimes you have to trade out one for the other, but you do that for the long-term health of the system and the growth of the category, which is what we're focused on.
And then your last point is about destocking on pods. It's not something that we've seen at retail and nor do we expect to see anything of that nature.

Our last question will come from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.

Stephen Robert R. Powers

Yes. I wanted to ask on free cash flow conversion. Sudhanshu, you talked about the improvement to come, which is great. I guess, is there a way to frame where you think you'll land on conversion for the year? And then as we think ahead, is there any reason for the return to 100% free cash flow conversion or thereabouts is too ambitious for '24 and beyond?
And I guess within that, if there's any changes that you're thinking about or that you've implemented more structurally with regards to supply chain financing that would be useful to know to?

Sudhanshu Shekhar Priyadarshi

No, it's a great question. As you know, KDP has been a highly cash generative since merger, and we expect to continue to generate significant free cash flow going forward. In our first half, our cash flow generation was lower primarily due to 2 factors versus last year. One was the lapping of some discrete items and also our proactive choice to selectively reduce a portion of our supplier financing program in a less attractive rate environment.
The free cash flow conversion will be significantly higher in the second half versus second quarter and also first half. Though it -- for the year, it will improve somewhat below 100% for the full year. But as you know, we look beyond 2023, we continue to target industry-leading levels of free cash flow conversion.
So there's not too many changes. We're still generating a lot of cash. It's a second half business, you will see it. But we are making some proactive choices with supply chain financing that was very attractive in low-rate environment, but now it's not that attractive.

Stephen Robert R. Powers

That last point, are you through with those changes or do you anticipate there may be still changes to come given where rates are and where they may go?

Sudhanshu Shekhar Priyadarshi

No. So we look at more of a -- it's a overall capital allocation policy as we came in, in December, and we have -- our growth is -- our goal is to maintain low leverage. But we generate a lot of cash. So we make those decisions case by case. So I wouldn't say that supply chain financing will -- or the number will become 0. But yes, we are looking at case by case, it's gradual, and we're looking at the benefit. This also has a benefit on operating income.
So it's -- first, in the beginning, you feel the most pain is the working capital has a short-term pain, but in the long run, it's beneficial and we make the right economic decision. So it's case by case. Supply chain financing is proactive choice. We're making the decision based on where we see is better economic benefit.
But it's a gradual and it will not happen everything this year, like we will not reduce everything to this year. It will continue for the next couple of years. It will be a gradual reduction.

Q2 in Detail

Adjusted earnings of 42 cents per share grew 7.7% year over year and came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents per share.

Net sales of $3,789 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,700 million. Also, the reported figure jumped 6.6% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis and increased 6.1% a constant-currency (cc) basis. Net price realization grew 8.2%, with a lower volume/mix of 2.1%.

In the reported quarter, Keurig Dr Pepper’s in-market performance in the Liquid Refreshment Beverages category remained sturdy, with retail dollar consumption growing 10.7% and market share expanding roughly 85% of KDP's cold beverage portfolio. This mainly reflected strength in CSDs, seltzers, energy, apple juice, coconut waters and fruit drinks. Also, strength in Dr Pepper and Squirt in CSDs as well as Polar seltzers, Vita Coco, C4 Energy, Evian, Mott's and Hawaiian Punch aided the results.

The overall at-home coffee category trends have been impacted by higher consumer mobility year over year, with the single serve pod segment expanding volume share of the category. U.S. retail dollar consumption of manufactured pods dipped 2.3% in IRi tracked channels during the reported quarter, while KDP Manufactured share was healthy at about 79%.

Adjusted gross profit rose 6.7% year over year to $2,076 million. The adjusted gross margin advanced 10 basis points year over year to 54.8% on reported basis, while the metric remained flat on cc basis. We had expected an adjusted gross margin of 54.5% for the quarter under discussion.

Adjusted operating income rose 4.4% to $873 million in the quarter. Meanwhile, the adjusted operating margin contracted 40 basis points to 23%.

Segmental Details

Sales in the U.S. Coffee segment declined 5.7% year over year to $970 million, reflecting improved net price realization of 1.6% and lower volume/mix of 7.3%. At-home coffee consumption continued to be impacted by mobility changes on a year-over-year basis. Further, pod revenues fell 4.6%, including a shipment drop of 7.7% mainly owing to the mobility-driven category softness and exit of certain lower-margin private label contracts.

On a trailing 12-month basis compared with the pre-pandemic second-quarter 2019 period, at-home pod shipments increased 16.9%, reflecting a mid-single digit compound annual growth rate. Brewer shipments totaled 9.9 million in the 12 months ending Jun 30, 2023, representing an 11% decline year over year.

Sales in the U.S. Refreshment Beverages segment totaled $2,330 million, up 11.8% year over year, reflecting higher net price realization of 12% and a 0.2% decline in volume/mix. The results were driven by recent innovations and effective in-market execution along with the contribution from its sales and distribution partnership for C4 Energy. In the quarter, we had expected sales of $2,180.3 million from the segment.

Sales in the International segment rose 10.9% year over year to $489 million, gaining from a favorable net price realization of 6.1% and a volume/mix rise of 0.9%. At cc, the segment’s net sales increased 7%. Also, solid momentum in Mexico and Canada aided results. Our estimate for sales from this segment was $442.3 million in the quarter.

However, for the United States, there are still challenges that need to be discussed first. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, a city with a population of 411,000 and a violent crime rate twice the national average, police officials are faced with the critical challenge of filling 160 vacant officer positions. The shortage of officers is also evident in other major cities across America, and city leaders and police chiefs often attribute this to the ""toxic"" national dialogue that has demonized police officers, particularly after the death of George Floyd in May 2020. The public expressions of distrust and protests against police have made recruitment difficult for law enforcement agencies. It also then explains why the job of police officers is one of the least trusted professions in America.

However, the issue goes beyond just police departments. Recruiters are finding it hard to fill other government positions such as firefighters and bus drivers as well. Employment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and Census Bureau reveals a steady decline in both law enforcement and local government jobs during the pandemic. From March 2020 to August 2022, government workers decreased by 5%, and local law enforcement employees decreased by 4%.

Despite the prevalent belief that anti-police sentiment is driving officers away, experts suggest that officers are leaving for better opportunities in the private sector, despite having one of the jobs that still offer traditional pensions. The allure of higher pay and more flexibility in starting their own businesses or working remotely has enticed some officers to switch careers. This trend has been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw a surge in early retirements across various professions, including the police. To read more about remote jobs, you can read our article about the best work-from-home jobs for 2023.

The decrease in police employment has been more pronounced in cities with over 1 million residents, like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, where the number of sworn officers dropped twice as fast as the national average. The pandemic also influenced the overall migration of the workforce from expensive urban areas to smaller cities, where remote work was more feasible and cost of living and average salaries were more favorable.

In response to the staffing shortages, some cities are offering signing bonuses to attract police officers and firefighters. However, the overall trend of declining government jobs, including law enforcement, raises concerns about critical labor shortages in various sectors. It is worth noting that law enforcement jobs can aslo be highly paid. For example, one of the highest-paid law enforcement positions is of a general counselor with an average annual salary of $126,283.

While the political and social landscape may contribute to officer burnout, the long-term impact of early retirements and an aging workforce, referred to as the ""silver tsunami,"" presents a broader challenge for recruitment and retention in government jobs.

On the other hand, in a recent report, it has been revealed that 77 retired senior U.S. military officials, including Generals and Admirals, have been engaged in high-paying jobs for foreign governments since 2012. These countries include Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the UAE. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Charles Grassley obtained this information from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and the top country of employment for these officers was the UAE, with over half of the approvals for work being with the Emirates.

While some may be surprised by the scale of this trend, it raises questions about the motivations behind these arrangements. The report highlights that certain retired officers gained approval to work for multiple foreign governments simultaneously which also raises concerns about their influence and connections back in Washington.

Now, coming to the career paths for former or retired law enforcement officers, we have found an interesting trend. With the emergence of cyber security, risk management, and corporate consulting, these industries have been highly promising and sought-after for retired law enforcement officers. They are believed to have personally fulfilling and financially rewarding prospects for those willing to step out beyond law enforcement.

The two giants associated with the industries of cyber security and risk management are Fortinet Inc (NASDAQ:FTNT) and Aon PLC (NYSE:AON) respectively. They not only offer promising careers in the field owing to their world-class work culture but have some of the highest salaries in the country. For example, while the average salary of a cyber-security analyst in the US is $87,876, the expected salary for the same job role at Fortinet Inc (NASDAQ:FTNT) is $119,253. Similarly, while the average salary for a risk manager is $100,002 in the US, the expected salary for a risk manager at Aon PLC (NYSE:AON) stands at $147,973. 16 High-Paying Jobs for Retired Law Enforcement Officers

Over the past two decades, the staffing industry has seen a rapid change. Gone are the days of aggressively searching newspapers and paper-postings to find employment opportunities. With stratospheric adoption of technology, human resource processes have drastically changed. Given this metamorphosis, businesses now face an unprecedented set of opportunities and challenges. Another major post pandemic change has been the demand for greater work flexibility by employers and employees. Following this, there is a strong expectation for freelance work opportunities to increase. Over the years, freelance platforms have presented a competitive ecosystem where businesses can attract candidates better suited to their needs. Furthermore, as remote work seems to be increasing, experts expect the market for staffing solutions to grow in accordance. With firms looking to outsource more human resource related affairs, competition is only expected to grow in the staffing sector.

Don't Miss: 12 Best Staffing Company Stocks To Buy Now

Another major development has been the inclusion of artificial intelligence in various professions. With companies such as Oracle working on developing AI to enhance innovation in business, McKinseyexpects staffing companies to take a similar approach by incorporating AI in their cloud-based human resource platforms. A survey by Gartner reported that while only 17% of total staffing companies used AI in 2019, the percentage was set to increase to over 30% by the end of 2022. Although AI can be incorporated in various staffing procedures, it presents a series of challenges as well. The biggest challenge would be the funding costs for development and integration of AI in processes. Safety, security, and privacy are other concerns that are inherently built into AI exploration. Another technical issue could be integrating new features into currently used systems. Needless to say, there is a room for a lot of innovation in the industry.

In 2021, the PGC Group reported that the staffing industry in the United States approximately grew by 28% to generate sales in excess of $186.9 billion. It was also reported that the sector had outgrown market expectations by $6 billion. In terms of market size, the US market dominates the industry. As per IBIS World, the total market for the human resources and staffing industry can potentially exceed $760 billion in 2023.

Investors looking to diversify their holdings and benefit from the growth opportunity in the human resources and staffing market can check out stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY), and Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP).

However, revenue for the period came in at $4.9 billion, beating market consensus by $40 million.

According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, a total of 19 hedge funds were bullish on ManpowerGroup Inc. (NYSE:MAN), as opposed to 20 in the last quarter of 2022. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management holds the largest position in the company, with 1.2 million shares worth $97.4 million.

Here is what Palm Valley Capital Management has to say about ManpowerGroup Inc. (NYSE:MAN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:

“We acquired four new positions during the quarter—two of these were recycled. The Fund bought back Kelly Services (NASDAQ:KELYA), a prior holding, and established a new weighting in ManpowerGroup (NYSE:MAN). Both companies serve the staffing industry. Staffing is cyclical, and we expect results for these companies to deteriorate in a recession, even though margins haven’t fully recovered yet from the lockdowns. In our judgment, during previous downturns, their operating performance was acceptable for a cyclical trough. We believe the valuations for Kelly and Manpower are becoming increasingly compelling. Kelly trades at a 46% discount to tangible book value. The company’s net assets are primarily supported by a mountain of receivables. Neither Kelly nor Manpower experienced significant credit losses during the last recession. ManpowerGroup’s $4 billion Enterprise Value is 6.7x its five-year average operating income before amortization, which includes a trough in 2020. Manpower is based in the U.S., but it earns the majority of revenues from Europe. We think the firm’s European exposure has placed it in the doghouse among investors, given the unique risks facing those economies. Manpower’s translated results are also weighed down by the rocketing U.S. dollar…” (Click here to see the full text)

Lakewood Capital Management had this to say about Insperity, Inc. (NYSE:NSP) in its Q2 2020 investor letter:

“Earlier this year, the fund initiated a position in Insperity, a provider of outsourced human resources for small- and medium-sized businesses. We began purchasing shares in February as the stock declined significantly following disappointing earnings and guidance related to an unusual spike in employee benefit costs. Subsequent share price declines during the March stock market sell-off, primarily due to concerns about the health of the company’s core customer base, allowed us to purchase additional shares in a high-quality, growing and cash generative business at an extremely discounted valuation.

Insperity operates what is called a Professional Employer Organization (PEO), whereby it serves as the co-employer for around 240,000 worksite employees (WSEs) across almost 9,000 companies. Insperity provides a wide range of human resources offerings to its clients and uses its position as a large “employer” to negotiate lower benefit pricing (including health insurance and workers’ compensation) than its clients would be able to obtain individually. This model has proven remarkably successful, with Insperity growing WSEs by 9% annually since 1999, while expanding gross profit and EBIT during the same period by 11% and 15% per annum, respectively. We believe there is a long runway for growth...” (Click here to see the full text)

According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 21 hedge funds were bullish on Robert Half Inc. (NYSE:RHI). Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management holds the largest position in Robert Half Inc. (NYSE:RHI), with over 1.1 million shares valued at $89.9 million.

FMI made the following comment about Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE:RHI) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE:RHI) is the market leader in professional staffing for small and medium sized businesses. The company has a premier temporary and permanent placement franchise in the field of accounting (Accountemps) and finance, while its Protiviti business has become a strong domestic and international consultancy. RHI’s reinvestment in technology, including its national database, candidate performance scoring, and proprietary AI and matching capabilities are driving share gains versus fragmented competition. The business model is asset-light and generates consistently strong returns-on-capital, industry leading margins, and free cash flow. The less cyclical Protiviti business accounts for 30% of income. Capital allocation at RHI has been focused on reinvestment, share repurchases, and dividend increases. These factors should result in less overall cyclicality in EPS going forward. The shares are off 40% from its 2022 highs. We feel that the discounted valuation is reflective of current recession worries, which could lower demand for labor. Additionally, there are concerns around AI and the disruption that it could have on accounting. Our view is that the sentiment around the latter appears overdone, as demand for accountants has increased over time despite major advances in productivity tools.”

Upwork facilitates labor and demand side connectivity on a global scale by providing the infrastructure to create trust and to streamline talent sourcing, contracting, analysis and payment. Freelancers benefit from having a reputation ranking system that feeds their marketing channels, allowing them to have access to quality, flexible work and on time compensation. Businesses on the demand side benefit by having extensive access to specialized talent, enabling faster and more cost effective hiring, and by having the strategic optionality inherent in the ability to flex a portion of their workforce based on changing demand requirements.

Labor markets have long had unnecessary frictional inefficiencies driven by regional talent imbalances and long-term trends of increased specialization of labor and declining labor mobility.

Lee Ainslie is the face and the brains behind Maverick Capital, a high-profile hedge fund with a net worth of about $4 billion. Founded in 1993, the hedge fund primarily invests in stocks while staying clear of bonds, commodities, currencies, and options. Some of its notable holdings are in tech giants, including Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which have helped reinvigorate the hedge fund's fortunes in recent months.

Ainslie's bio is one that speaks volumes in addition to being the managing partner of Maverick Capital. Before founding the hedge fund in 1993, he was the managing director of Tiger Management. He also serves on the boards of Robin Hood Foundation  and the Economic  Club of New York. Lee Ainslie wife is Elizabeth Ainslie.

The father of two, Ainslie has made a name for himself as a pure long/short equity investor. He primarily focuses on stocks he thinks will beat the market and sells those he thinks will underperform. Over the years, the hedge fund manager has beaten the S&P 500 by 6% to 7% percentage points with 50% less volatility. Lee Ainslie net worth of over $1B stems from stellar performance of Maverick Capital hedge fund with bets on Salesforce  Facebook and Meta all of which have exploded in 2023.

However, Ainslie had a first quarter to forget as Maverick Capital fell into the red, losing 22.9% compared to a 4.6% gain of the S&P 500. One key factor behind the massive loss is the hedge fund's significant holding in Coupang, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of the losses. The hedge fund's fortunes were also hurt by its biotech stocks holdings that remained under pressure.

According to Ainslie, a decline in dollar volume M&A activity in the biotech sector hurt the segment as the impact of discount rates on valuation multiple also fueled the weakness. Fast forward, the hedge fund appears to have found its footing thanks to Ainslie's solid stock picks, especially in the tech space.

Investments in Amazon, Nvidia, Netflix, and Microsoft should help offset losses in other sectors as the tech stocks have posted double-digit gains amid the AI boom. In addition to betting big on tech giants, Ainslie is going short on housing and durable stocks as he does not expect spending on home improvements or furnishing to assume growth to the elevated levels recorded in 2021.

In addition to shorting housing and durable stocks, Ainslie initiated a new position in Masimo Corporation (NASDAQ:MASI) in the first quarter of 2022, a high-quality, high-growth company on the right side of changes in healthcare. According to Ainslie, Masimo is a clear leader in pulse oximetry, a duopoly segment with contracts running five to seven years. Masimo products outperform those of its peers, resulting in better patient outcomes and lower patient costs. Therefore, the company boasts a solid recurring revenue base of 80% with an average customer retention rate of 98%. Lee Ainslie Washington Commanders and Other Investments.

In Q1 2023, Maverick Capital's portfolio value declined from $4.22 billion to $3.95 billion. The fund added 194 new stocks, boosted its holdings in 157 stocks, sold off 122 stocks, and reduced its exposure in 94 stocks. Ainslie’s favored consumer discretionary stocks, which made up 43.47% of the portfolio, followed by information technology stocks, which accounted for 20.22% of the portfolio in the first quarter of 2023.

Revenues grew +10% (foreign exchange adjusted) whereas operating income grew +14%, helped by +18% growth in Office365 and 31% growth in Azure and other cloud services. Although the Company guided to a deceleration in its core businesses, Microsoft has ample opportunity to drive attractive double-digit growth over a multi-year timeframe. We recognize investors have disproportionately favored software and tech stocks year to date, driving multiples to relative and historical highs. As a result, we paired some of our weighting in Microsoft earlier in the year; however, it remains a core position in portfolios.”

“Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): Uber was a top contributor in the quarter following better-than-expected 4Q results and 1Q guidance. Gross Bookings grew 19% year over year to $31 billion, driven by 31% Mobility Gross Bookings growth and 6% Delivery Growth Bookings growth. 4Q Adjusted EBITDA of $665 million, up $579 million year over year, significantly beating management’s $600-$630 million guidance. Management guided to continuing growth in 1Q for Gross Bookings (20%- 24% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $660-$700 million).

UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the potential for substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 131 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, truck brokerage (the company had $1.5 billion in Freight revenue for 4Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4 billion of unrestricted cash and $5 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $70 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 1.6x next year’s estimated revenue.”

2023-07-31T15:37:19+00:00,3 Fashion Stocks Worth Buying for the ‘Barbie’ Boost,"The movie Barbie is a global hit. Just one week after its release, the film has grossed nearly $500 million worldwide, including $214 million at the North American box office. The movie about the iconic Barbie and Ken dolls made by toy company Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) has struck a chord with audiences and is helping to revive box office fortunes that were devastated during the Covid-19 pandemic. The domestic box office that includes the U.S. and Canada generated $1.8 billion of sales in the first three months of this year, which was 25% below pre-pandemic 2019 levels. Box office distributors and film studios are hoping Barbie can lead to higher grosses throughout the remainder of summer.

However, it is not just the box office where Barbie is having an impact. Many other economic sectors are getting a boost, notably the fashion industry as people dress up like Barbie and Ken to attend screenings of the film. Here are three fashion stocks worth buying for the Barbie boost.

Barbie and Ken are preppy fashion icons, and there is no company more associated with the preppy look than Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL). The company that popularized the polo shirt has been on a tear lately, with its stock up 35% over the last 12 months — including an 18% gain in 2023. With consumer spending holding strong, especially among affluent Americans, it has benefitted Ralph Lauren. At the end of May, the company posted an impressive first-quarter earnings beat.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The fashion retailer announced Q1 earnings per share of 90 cents, which beat consensus forecasts of 65 cents. Revenue in the quarter came in at $1.54 billion, which was better than the $1.52 billion that had been expected on Wall Street. Ralph Lauren also boasts a strong balance sheet, with $1.5 billion of cash and only $1.1 billion of long-term debt at the end of March. Trading at 16 times forward earnings, RL stock looks reasonably valued. And, the stock pays a quarterly dividend of 75 cents a share, which is good for a yield of 2.34%.

Both Ken and Barbie like to stay fit and hang out at the beach. And what better wardrobe for those activities than Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU)? The athletic apparel retailer that caused a sensation with its yoga pants and other workout gear has seen its stock perform strongly over many years. LULU shares have increased 16% this year, 27% in the last 12 months, and 213% over five years. The company continues to ride the enduring popularity of its athletic wear to new heights.

The company’s latest fashion sensation is its bestselling “Everywhere Belt Bag.” Essentially a fanny pack worn like a purse, the belt bag has gone viral and become a social media sensation. The company’s ability to successfully market different products and make many of the items it sells viral sensations has contributed to its success. At the start of June, LULU stock jumped 15% on a Q1 earnings beat. The company announced that its revenue rose 24% in Q1 to $2 billion, sending Wall Street analysts scrambling to revise their forecasts on the stock. As far as fashion stocks go, this is one investors definitely don’t want to overlook.

Barbie is known for her hair and make-up as much as her clothes, and what better cosmetic stock to own than Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA). The retail chain of beauty stores has more than 1,200 locations that collectively sell $10 billion worth of cosmetics and fragrances each year. With more than 35,000 employees, Ulta Beauty has been growing at a quick rate, pushing its share price up in the process. ULTA stock has increased 14% in the last 12 months and is up 80% over the past five years.

However, ULTA stock has dipped recently and is 18% below its 52-week high, presenting a decent entry point for investors. Despite the share price drop, Ulta Beauty continues to attract consumers, reporting customer traffic rose 11% in its most recent quarter. The company also enjoys a high profit margin of 17% versus just 6% among other retailers such as Target (NYSE:TGT). And, unlike competing cosmetic companies such as Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL), Ulta Beauty does not have a lot of exposure to China, where consumer sales are waning.

The July Rate Hike

On July 26, the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates once again, this time by 25 basis points. The 0.25% hike has brought interest rates up to about 5.25% to 5.50%, which is the highest level of interest rates in over 22 years. The decision to hike rates this month was unanimous at the Fed, and it was also signaled that the public can expect to see even further rate hikes up ahead this year. Considering this hike, the investing community continues to be plagued with inflation-related concerns and what the current interest rate levels will mean for businesses and consumers heading into the second half of the year. For many, the jump to such a high level of interest rates is proving to be a source of market uncertainty and turbulence, while others are holding on to the belief that the Fed will manage to bring inflation down to a maximum rate of 2% in the long run, as has been affirmed in the Federal Open Market Committee statement.

In light of this hike, in a CNBC interview on July 26, David Kelly from JPMorgan Asset Management made the following comments on how he views stocks progressing in the market over the next six months and beyond:

""I look at valuations a lot and I do worry about the mega-cap stocks that have really led this charge. But overall I think it good be pretty good because the key point is, eventually inflations gonna get back down to where we were in the last decade, it's gonna get back down to 2%. Eventually, the Fed's gonna have to react to a recession and cut rates back down again and so you get back to a slow growth, low inflation environment in which companies are very good at maintaining margins. I mean that's the other message that we've seen from the earnings reports so far this month. You know, there's a problem with revenues, but they're doing a great job at maintaining margins. I think US companies can do well in a cold climate, and I think the stock market is taking comfort from that.""

Navigating The Market After The Hike

According to Kelly, it is becoming increasingly important to keep an eye on stock valuations heading into the second half of the year to ensure one does not end up with overpriced stocks in the event of a market correction. For him, the choice sectors to keep an eye on include industrials and financials. Overall though, Kelly's opinion seems to be that even in the event of a recession, US companies can be expected to perform well enough to satisfy their shareholders.

Considering the above, it has become abundantly clear that investors today should really consider factors like stock valuations, potential impacts of the recent rate hike, higher prices, and much more when they are making their investments. Another factor that might be worth considering is the performance of companies that are steadily gaining popularity among the younger generations of consumers and investors today. These up-and-coming stocks, such as e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), are now offering products to a new cohort of consumers that are setting them apart from their competitors and increasing consumer engagement. Some may consider them to be some of the best stocks to invest in right now, and many of the names on our list below can be considered to be some of the best growth stocks for the next 10 years even. In light of imminent market uncertainty and recession-related concerns, we have thus compiled the list below to give investors today some more choices that may be beneficial additions to their portfolios.  11 Best Up And Coming Stocks To Invest In

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30

Teladoc Health, Inc (NYSE:TDOC) is a healthcare company based in Purchase, New York. It operates through its Integrated Care and BetterHelp segments. The company is steadily making a name for itself in the healthcare sector with its telehealth services, allowing patients to consult with medical professionals on its videoconferencing platform.

Like e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), Teladoc Health, Inc (NYSE:TDOC) is a stock that has become increasingly popular among individual investors and hedge funds alike this year.

Shares of value-oriented beauty brand ELF received a meaningful boost from normalizing beauty usage and spending in a post-COVID environment, which we believe has contributed to its premium multiple relative to competitors in the beauty space. As this temporary lift unwinds, we expect elf’s valuation to similarly return to a level better aligned with its product offerings.”

9. Crocs, Inc. (NASDAQ:CROX)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31

Crocs designs, develops, manufactures and distributes casual footwear and accessories for men, women and children. The company invented the molded plastic Clog in 2002 and has turned it into a $3B global revenue base. We believe revenue growth will continue to surprise to the upside driven by expansion opportunities outside the US, demand from new product introductions (including from recently acquired Hey Dude) and a distribution push both within the direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels. Given the company is still small in terms of a global market share (its $4B in revenues puts them at 1% global market share of the footwear industry), we believe there is a long runway for growth and initiated a GardenSM position.”

“We initiated a position in Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN), a global medical device company best known for its “Invisalign” clear aligners, having created the clear aligner category in 1999. Since that time, it has been a disruptor of the traditional use of wire and bracket braces to straighten teeth and treat malocclusions. While it is leader in the clear aligner category with roughly 85-90% market share, the bigger competition is taking share from wire and brackets and on that measure, it only has 10-15% share of the overall teeth straightening market. Over time, through innovation and vertical integration, the company has evolved to be able to treat over 90% of all cases. Further, it has done a great job deepening relationships with orthodontists and general practitioner dentists over time. All in all, we believe this is a business with a durable competitive advantage, operating in a large, growing and very attractive industry, led by a proven and long-term oriented management team, with a very long runway ahead of it to grow and compound at very attractive rates.”

Significantly high institutional ownership implies Paychex's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions A total of 14 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Recent sales by insiders

If you want to know who really controls Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 74% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).

Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.

Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Paychex.

See our latest analysis for Paychex  ownership-breakdown

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Paychex?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

Paychex already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Paychex's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

Story continues earnings-and-revenue-growth

Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Paychex is not owned by hedge funds. Because actions speak louder than words, we consider it a good sign when insiders own a significant stake in a company. In Paychex's case, its Top Key Executive, B. Golisano, is the largest shareholder, holding 10% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 8.6%.

After doing some more digging, we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.

Insider Ownership Of Paychex

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.

Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.

Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Paychex, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$46b, and insiders have US$4.9b worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public-- including retail investors -- own 16% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

2023-07-28T21:07:00+00:00,3 Under-the-Radar Large-Cap Stocks to Buy in August,"Stocks surged higher on Friday. The positivity came after the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge showcased cooling prices and hit its lowest level in nearly two years.

Jay Powell didn’t declare victory over inflation when the Fed raised rates by 0.25% on Wednesday. But he certainly wasn’t hawkish either.

Wall Street is growing increasingly confident that the Fed is all but done hiking. On top of that, the earnings picture is holding up very well as we get deeper into the heart of Q2 earnings season.

With this in mind, we dive into three somewhat under-the-radar large-cap stocks that all reported upbeat quarterly results already that investors might want to buy as we head into August.

Paychex (PAYX)

Paychex is a software company focused on payroll and other HR-centric offerings such as benefit management, insurance, and beyond. Paychex’s growing suite of HR-based software and technology has helped it amass roughly 740k customers across the U.S. and Europe. The firm is not a household name like Salesforce and some other business software companies. Yet Paychex boasts that its software helps pay one out of every 12 private sector employees in the U.S.

Paychex has grown its revenue and earnings at steady clips over the last decade, including 14% top-line expansion in its fiscal 2022 and 9% in FY23—period ended on May 31, 2023—to reach $5 billion for the first time. Looking ahead, PAYX’s revenue is projected to pop 7% in FY24 and another 5% in FY25 to reach $5.62 billion. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are expected to climb by 10% in FY24 and 7% higher in its fiscal 2024, which comes on top of 13% EPS growth last year. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Paychex’s earnings revisions have continued to climb over the last several years and its more recent upbeat EPS trends help it grab a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. The company boosted its dividend payout by 13% earlier this year, with a yield of 2.8% right now. It is worth stressing as well that digital payroll services and more are nearly ubiquitous and never going out of style.

Story continues

Paychex stock has climbed 210% in the last decade to top the S&P 500 and its industry, which are both up around 180%. PAYX shares have surged 72% in the past three years, but are down around 1% in the past 12 months vs. the benchmark’s 10% climb. That said, the stock has ripped 16% higher since its Q4 FY23 report on June 29. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Despite the rebound, Paychex trades 9% below its record highs. Plus, PAYX climbed back above its 50-week moving average in early July and it is now above its 50-day and 200-day, with it prepared to complete the golden cross, where the shorter-dated trendline climbs back above the longer-term trend. Paychex is also trading at a 25% discount to its highs at 26.9X forward earnings and right near its own decade-long median.

Textron (TXT)

Textron operates in the broader Aerospace – Defense segment with a wide-range of offerings in the field, as well as far more commercial segments. TXT’s various units and brands include Bell, Cessna, Beechcraft, Pipistrel, Arctic Cat, and more. For instance, Arctic Cat is a leader in the snowmobile and the small off-road vehicle space such as ATVs and side-by-sides. Textron’s Cessna unit is a major player in the world of private aviation for business travel and other, mostly non-commercial flight.

Textron’s Pipistrel segment is attempting to push the boundaries of electric aircrafts. TXT’s portfolio also includes Bell, which landed a potentially huge contract with the U.S. Army in late 2022. Textron’s next-generation helicopters are set to become the U.S. Army’s new long-range assault aircraft. The contract could be worth up to $80 billion based on multiple reports. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Textron, which currently lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), on July 27 posted an impressive beat-and-raise quarter. TXT topped our Q2 EPS estimate by 22%, with its adjusted earnings up 32% YoY. The company also boosted its bottom-line outlook to between $5.20 - $5.30 a share vs. our current $5.09 consensus, which would already mark 27% growth.

Zacks estimates call for another solid year of bottom-line expansion in FY24 and strong revenue expansion. And expect analysts to raise these outlooks in the coming days and weeks following TXT’s Q2 report.

Textron earlier this month said it approved a new stock buyback program. And six of the 11 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys,” next to five “Holds.”

TXT stock is up 165% in the last 10 years to blow away its Aerospace – Defense industry’s 29%. This run includes a 121% surge in the last 36 months. TXT stock has, however, chopped around rather heavily over the last two years. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Textron is now up 8% YTD, after it soared following its blowout Q2 results and guidance. TXT is attempting to hit new highs and break out of its current range. TXT is now back above its 50-week moving average and it soared above its 200-day.

TXT currently trades below its average Zacks price target. Some investors might appreciate that it sits at around $76 per share, while Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman both trade for around $450 per share.

Despite its long-term outperformance of the Aerospace – Defense industry, Textron trades at a roughly 40% discount at 14.4X forward 12-month earnings. TXT’s current valuation also represents 9% value vs. its own decade-long median and 32% compared to its own highs.

United Rentals (URI)

United Rentals is one of the world’s largest equipment rental firms. URI’s portfolio allows its customers, which include construction firms, utility companies, and far beyond, to rent scissor lifts, towable light towers, generators, and nearly everything else under the sun. The firm’s revenue was booming prior to Covid, with sales up between 15% to 21% for three straight years until they slipped in 2020. But URI quickly left its setbacks behind and posted 14% sales growth in FY21 and 20% in 2022. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

United Rentals has been able to lift its prices alongside inflation, while benefiting from its Ahern Rentals acquisition in late 2022. United Rentals carried over its momentum into 2023, and it topped our Q2 earnings and revenue estimates on July 26.

URI, which grabs a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now, also boosted its FY23 outlook. CEO Matthew Flannery said in prepared remarks that it remains “encouraged by the momentum we are carrying into the busiest part of our season as well as our customers’ continued optimism.”

Current Zacks estimates call for URI’s sales to jump 20% in 2023 and another 4% in 2024. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to surge by 22% and 9%, respectively. And expect these projections to improve as more analysts update their outlooks. United Rentals aims to keep capitalizing on multi-year tailwinds across infrastructure, manufacturing, and energy and power. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

URI has surged 650% in the past 10 years to crush the S&P 500’s 180% and the Zacks construction sector’s 160%. United Rentals is up 37% in the last 12 months, with it hovering around 8% below its all-time highs.

The stock found support at its 50-week moving back in May, and its recent run has it trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. And URI is trading at a 40% discount to its own decade-long highs and right at its median of 10.6X forward 12-month earnings.

According to Precedence Research, the size of the logistics industry stood at $10.68 trillion at the end of 2022. The industry is set to experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.48% to reach a size of $18.23 trillion by 2032. Meanwhile, London, UK-based professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) estimates that the logistics industry generates an estimated annual revenue of $4.6 trillion. Presently, the North American region dominates the logistics industry. The logistics industry can be broadly categorized into three notable groups based on their business models. A first-party logistics (1PL) provider is a basic form of logistics management where a company or organization handles its own logistics operations internally. A second-party logistics (2PL) provider comes into play when a company engages in a direct logistics partnership with another company. Meanwhile, a third-party logistics (3PL) provider is a dedicated entity that handles the transportation, inventory management, warehousing, and other services for any company.

One of the main drivers in the growth of the global logistics industry is the boom in the e-commerce industry. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the contribution of e-commerce sales as part of total retail sales from 16% to 19% in 2020. Leading e-commerce companies like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), and PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) experienced their top-line increase by 70% between 2019 and 2021 and the total share of these prominent e-commerce platforms as a percentage of total global e-commerce sales increased from 75% in 2019 to 80% in 2021.  Such dynamic growth in the e-commerce industry has resulted in some of the biggest global logistics and shipping companies expanding their operations and investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), automated warehouses, the Internet of Things (IoT), predictive analysis, and real-time tracking.

The logistics industry is anticipated to experience tailwinds as road connectivity in developing countries is now improving. This improvement in road connectivity is expected to offer greater upside potential to the best transportation stocks, such as CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX), FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), and Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP). One notable measure intended to give a boost to the industry is the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), also known as the New Silk Road, launched by China in 2013. The initiative includes a wide network of highways and railroads expanding into former Soviet countries in the West. Meanwhile, in the South, China intends to expand this network through its neighboring countries, Pakistan and India. China has been able to reach agreements with 147 countries of the world that are responsible for contributing two-thirds of the global gross domestic product (GDP). The biggest component of the BRI is the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), with an estimated cost of $62 billion. To date, China has spent over $1 trillion on the BRI, with experts believing that the total outlay could reach $8 trillion by the time of completion. Investors seeking opportunities in the logistics sector are considering investing in trucking stocks with dividends and freight stocks. 11 Best Logistics Stocks to Buy

9. XPO, Inc. (NYSE:XPO)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30

“XPO, Inc. (NYSE:XPO) is the fourth largest less-than-truckload (LTL) service provider in North America. Following its late October spin-off of RXO, Inc., which provides freight brokerage services and last mile logistics, XPO has become a solid pureplay LTL company. During the period, shares of XPO outperformed after the RXO spin-off transaction was consummated in late October and helped unlock the sum of parts value as the market was undervaluing both assets.

Dollar Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $786,246,000

J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:JBHT) is a Lowell, Arkansas-based logistics and truckload transportation services provider that came into being in 1961.

In a note issued to investors on June 30, an analyst at Citi increased the price target on J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:JBHT) from $200 to $207 and reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. The analyst anticipates modestly improving trends for the trucking industry during the second half of this year. There is a widespread belief that the truckload-levered transporters will see a bottom in Q2 2023.

Wedgewood Partners shared its stance on J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:JBHT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:

“As we continue to familiarize our clients with our SMID portfolio’s holdings, we would like to discuss our significant exposure to the U.S. Transportation industry. We currently have three transportation holdings and have been substantially overweight the industry in comparison to the Russell 2500 index for several years. While these undoubtedly are cyclical business models, we see many long-term tailwinds for the domestic Transportation industry, which will provide attractive growth levels and will allow these companies to improve their returns on investment over time.

J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:JBHT) is the country’s largest independent provider of intermodal transportation services, with smaller businesses in trucking and logistics. Intermodal transportation refers to freight deliveries that require the use of more than one “mode” of transportation, most often including some combination of ocean, railroad, and truck between source and destination. J.B. Hunt generally provides the rail portion of these intermodal loads.

J.B. Hunt benefited from the exacerbated shortage in Truckload capacity in both their intermodal business—where they could directly substitute railroad service for people who weren’t able to find TL capacity—and in their smaller, but rapidly growing Dedicated TL division, where the company takes over all or a portion of a shipping customer’s trucking fleet. While customers were paying significantly higher prices and still struggling to find any trucking capacity, they found it very attractive to contract for a dedicated, outsourced fleet with J.B. Hunt.”

6. Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37

Dollar Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $571,041,000

Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL) is a Thomasville, North Carolina-based LTL freight service provider that was established in 1934. The company has the distinction of having 12 billionaires amongst its shareholders, with an estimated combined holding value of $311.9 million.

Transportation and logistics provider ArcBest reported Friday that less-than-truckload shipments from core accounts have increased 10% in the past week.

The company didn’t cite a potential shutdown at competitor Yellow Corp. (NASDAQ: YELL) as the reason but it did say it has renewed its focus on primary accounts, following a period in which it leaned heavily on transactional shipments (dynamic pricing) to keep the network full.

Old Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ: ODFL) noted a 6% uptick in volumes over the last few days when it reported second-quarter results on Wednesday.

“ArcBest is uniquely positioned to meet customers’ needs, especially in a market that is rapidly changing,” stated Judy McReynolds, chairman, president and CEO. “We serve as trusted advisors — ready to keep customer supply chains moving with a full suite of logistics solutions, including a nationwide network of asset-based LTL capacity.” Table: ArcBest’s key performance indicators

ArcBest (NASDAQ: ARCB) reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.54 Friday before the market opened. The result was 51 cents light of consensus and well below the year-ago result.

ArcBest’s asset-based unit, which includes less-than-truckload operations, reported a 10% year-over-year (y/y) decline in revenue to $722 million as tonnage was up 1% and revenue per hundredweight, or yield, fell 11% inclusive of fuel surcharges. The yield metric was up against a tough comp (up 18% y/y) from the second quarter of 2022. Lower fuel prices, down nearly 30% y/y in the period, weighed on the comparison as well.

Excluding fuel, yield was off by a mid-single-digit percentage on LTL shipments. However, pricing on the company’s core LTL business (excluding fuel) increased y/y by a high-single-digit percentage. Contract renewals and deferred pricing agreements saw an average y/y increase of 3.1%.

A news release said less freight from core customers, smaller shipments and lower fuel surcharges were some of the revenue headwinds. Less-than-truckload tonnage increased from the first quarter but shipments were flat, “which is weaker than normal, seasonal expectations,” it noted.

Story continues

The company said it recently implemented a cost-savings plan in the unit, which resulted in total daily shipments declining 5% from the second quarter. Even with the increase in core LTL shipments over the last week, the company’s transition from dynamic pricing has kept volumes lower in the month. However, the volume weakness will likely be cured quickly if Yellow closes.

Total yield was down 7% y/y in July. Pricing on core LTL business was up by a low-single-digit percentage excluding fuel.

The unit posted a 92.8% operating ratio, 830 basis points worse y/y. Most expenses as a percentage of revenue were higher, including the compensation line, which was up 680 bps.  The company said it will increase the usage of training programs and prioritize service to core accounts.

The company’s asset-light division, which includes truck brokerage, reported a 25% y/y decline in revenue to $410 million. The unit’s adjusted OR deteriorated 390 bps to 98.4%.

ArcBest will host a call to discuss results with analysts at 9:30 a.m. EDT Friday.

Management from Old Dominion Freight Line noted demand has ticked up in recent days but didn’t attribute the increase to troubles at Yellow Corp.

Over the last few days, shipments per day have increased from 47,000 to 50,000, however, management said it’s typical to see volumes step higher at the end of July. The carrier may not be the first choice for shippers if Yellow Corp. (NASDAQ: YELL) were to shut down as the two reside at the opposite ends of the service-pricing spectrum.

“We’re very disciplined on price and we’re not going to do anything to trash our service by taking on too much freight,” said Marty Freeman, Old Dominion president and CEO, on a Wednesday call with analysts. “We expect if something were to happen that we would remain disciplined.”

Management did say the company could get business from other carriers that may suffer service issues if they take on volume from Yellow too quickly.

Old Dominion (NASDAQ: ODFL) reported second-quarter earnings per share of $2.65 Wednesday before the market opened. The number was in line with the consensus estimate but 65 cents lower year over year (y/y).

The less-than-truckload carrier saw consolidated revenue fall 15% y/y to $1.41 billion, the combination of a 14% drop in tonnage per day and a 1% decline in revenue per hundredweight, or yield. Excluding fuel surcharges, yield was 8% higher in the quarter. Retail diesel fuel prices were down 29% y/y on average in the period.

LTL revenue excluding the impact of fuel was down 8% y/y. Management expects fuel to be less of a revenue headwind in the back half of the year as prices started declining this time last year.

Revenue declined 2% from the first quarter. The normal seasonal progression is an increase of 10%. Tonnage was down 2% sequentially versus a normal increase of 7%. Management said shipments had largely been consistent since December until the recent uptick over the last few days. If the trend holds, revenue is expected to decline between 14% and 14.5% y/y in July with tonnage down 11.5% to 12%.

Yield excluding fuel surcharges is up between 6.5% and 7% so far in the month. Table: Old Dominion’s key performance indicators

Even with volume weakness and cost inflation, the company recorded a 72.3% operating ratio, which was just 280 basis points worse y/y.

Salaries, wages and benefits (as a percentage of total revenue) increased 320 bps even as head count declined 10% y/y and 2% sequentially. Depreciation and amortization expense was 160 bps higher y/y. Lighter loads also appeared to weigh on margins. Average weight per shipment was down 3% y/y in the quarter.

Despite the modest sequential dip in revenue, operating income was up 2% from the first quarter, reflecting prudent cost management. The company saw better efficiency in the period as platform shipments per hour increased 6.6% and pick-and-delivery shipments per hour were up 0.5%.

Looking to the third quarter, the company expects OR to deteriorate between 50 and 100 bps as depreciation and amortization, general supplies and miscellaneous expenses are expected to increase. Overall, management said its cost per shipment numbers are moderating.

With the softer demand environment, the company has 30% excess capacity in its network currently, which is about 5 percentage points higher than normal. Old Dominion prefers to “stay ahead of the curve” regarding investments due to the lag time it takes to add capacity when the market shifts.

“We do not always know when an inflection point in the demand environment is going to occur but we believe we are well positioned to respond to any acceleration in volumes when it happens,” Freeman said.

The carrier has put forth a plan to handle additional business should Yellow close. However, its base case forecast assumes the market is “at the end of a long, slow cycle” and volumes will start to improve by the end of the year as broader customer conversations have recently become more constructive. The comments are also likely reflective of easier tonnage comps from a year ago when the freight market rolled over in the second half.

Old Dominion generated $288 million in cash flow from operations in the quarter and $703 million in the first half of 2023. It reiterated capital expenditures guidance of $700 million, which includes $260 million in real estate investments, $365 million for tractors and trailers and $75 million for information technology projects.

In addition to capex, the company announced it will use cash flows to buy back another $3 billion in company stock in addition to the $377 million remaining on its current share repurchase program.

Shares of Old Dominion and other LTL carriers were up more than 5% at 1:30 p.m. EDT on Wednesday compared to the S&P 500, which was down 0.2%. Shares of YELL were 9.7% higher at the time.

2023-07-26T21:09:00+00:00,3 Top-Rated Stocks to Buy on the Earnings Beat,"Intriguingly, several top-rated Zacks stocks are standing out from various sectors after beating earnings expectations on Wednesday.

With opportunity brewing, Sherwin-Williams (SHW), Kimberly-Clark (KMB), and PACCAR (PCAR) are three such stocks that investors should consider.

Let’s review their strong quarterly reports and see why now is a good time to buy going forward.

Sherwin-Williams Q2 Review: There was a lot to like about Sherwin-Williams’ Q2 report on Wednesday and its stock currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Highlights included gross margin improving 46% YoY driven by strong sales volume in the company’s Paint Store Group segment along with double-digit percentage growth in earnings per share and EBITDA.

Sherwin-Williams easily topped earnings expectations with EPS at $3.29 and 21% above estimates of $2.71 a share. On the top line, sales came in 4% above estimates at $6.24 billion. Overall, Q2 earnings soared 36% from the prior year quarter with sales up 6% from a year ago. Zacks Investment Research

Kimberly-Clark Q2 Review: Gross margin expansion was also a highlight of Kimberly-Clark’s Q2 report yesterday with its stock currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Gross margin was 33.7% up a respectable 3.5% from a year ago. Kimberly-Clark also highlighted another quarter of strong organic sales growth and raised its 2023 outlook for organic growth to 3%-5% and 10%-14% for adjusted earnings per share growth.

To that point, Kimberly-Clark delivered double-digit earnings growth during Q2 with EPS climbing 23% YoY to $1.65 per share which topped estimates by 11%. Sales slightly beat expectations at $5.13 billion and rose 1% from a year ago. Kimberly-Clark stated its growth strategy is working with the consumer products giant completing the sale of its Brazil tissue assets in June while launching a new marketing campaign for its renowned diaper brand Huggies. Zacks Investment Research

PACCAR Q2 Review: With a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Paccar stock remains attractive after the company announced the achievement of record revenues and net income for the second quarter on Wednesday.

The success was driven by increased truck deliveries (51,900 units), strong gross margins, and strengthening results from its parts distribution segment. Paccar’s record net income came in at $1.22 billion which soared 70% from $720.4 million in Q2 2022.

This translated into EPS of $2.33 which beat earnings expectations by 8%. Second-quarter sales of $8.44 billion topped estimates by 2% and climbed 24% from the prior-year quarter. PACCAR also highlighted that it will increase its quarterly dividend by 8% from $0.25 per share to $0.27 per share, further bolstering the company’s strong business environment.

Bottom Line

Now is a good time to buy these top-rated Zacks stocks as their strong Q2 reports reconfirmed their strengthening outlooks. It’s quite plausible that earnings estimate revisions will continue to trend higher for Sherwin-Williams, Kimberly-Clark, and Paccar's stock which should lead to more upside following their stellar quarterly results.

During the second quarter, we are pleased to announce the expansion of our strategic partnership with Toyota to develop and bring to market zero emissions hydrogen fuel cell-powered Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks. PACCAR powertrain portfolio of hydrogen fuel cell, hydrogen combustion, battery electric and clean diesel technologies position the company and our customers for an excellent future.
PACCAR Financial also had an excellent quarter, achieving profits of $145 million due to its high-quality portfolio and positive used truck results.
Looking at the truck market. Industry build has been gradually increasing this year. And in the U.S. and Canada, we estimate the Class 8 market to be in the range of 290,000 to 320,000 trucks. The 2023 European truck market is expected to be in a range of 300,000 to 330,000 units. We project the South American above 16-tonne truck market to be in a range of 105,000 to 115,000 vehicles this year. South America is an important region for PACCAR's geographic growth. DAF Brasil has done an excellent job growing market share since we opened the business 10 years ago, achieving a record 9.2% share in the first 6 months of this year. As we look forward to the rest of this year, and 2024, the truck markets are expected to remain healthy and PACCAR will continue to deliver excellent performance.
Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on PACCAR Parts, PACCAR Financial Services and other business highlights.

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers

Thanks, Preston. PACCAR delivered 51,900 trucks during the second quarter. Supply chain is improving, though occasional supplier shortages still limit production. We estimate third quarter deliveries to be in the range of 48,000 to 52,000 trucks. The third quarter delivery estimate reflects the normal summer shutdown in Europe. PACCAR achieved strong truck parts and other gross margins of 18.8% in the second quarter. We estimate third quarter gross margins to be in the 18% to 19% range, reflecting continued high-level performance of PACCAR's Truck and Parts business.
PACCAR Parts achieved strong second quarter gross margins of 31.6%. The Parts business continued its track record of high sales and profit growth, with quarterly sales growing by 11% and profits by 19% compared to the same period last year. PACCAR Parts is focused on expanding its customer base, and providing a full range of technology-enabled transportation solutions is driving its excellent results. In the last 5 years, annual part sales have grown by 73%, and Parts profits have increased by 136%. The consistent performance of parts as a high-growth, high-margin business is structurally beneficial to PACCAR. Third quarter Parts sales are expected to increase 6% to 8% compared to the same period last year. PACCAR Parts' growth is supported by a network of 18 distribution centers, more than 2,000 dealer locations and 250 independent ERP stores, as well as technologies like managed dealer inventory and innovative e-commerce systems. PACCAR Parts continues to expand and will open a new distribution center in Massbach, Germany next year. Each new distribution center increases the number of dealers and customers benefiting from receiving parts on the same or next day.
PACCAR Financial Services' second quarter pretax income was a solid $145 million. The Financial Services business benefited from excellent portfolio quality and good used truck results. Used truck prices have moderated, but are historically strong. With its larger portfolio and superb credit quality, PACCAR Financial is having another very good year. PACCAR has invested $7.5 billion in new and expanded facilities innovative products and new technologies during the past decade. These investments have created the newest and most impressive lineup of trucks in the industry and will contribute to excellent performance for many years. PACCAR's after tax return on invested capital improved to an industry-leading 35% in the first half of the year, up from 22% in the same period last year. Capital expenditures are projected to be $625 million to $675 million this year, and research and development expenses are estimated to be $400 million to $430 million.
PACCAR's industry-leading truck lineup, highly efficient manufacturing operations, best-in-class Parts and Financial Services businesses and the continued development of advanced technologies position the company well for today and for the future. 
Thank you. We'd be pleased to answer your questions.

Question and Answer Session

(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Steve Volkmann from Jefferies.

Stephen Edward Volkmann

Preston, since you brought it up, I'm curious if you might be willing to provide any additional thoughts on 2024 being a robust year. Do you guys have orders for '24? And how much visibility and how much confidence do you have that 2024 can be a robust year?

R. Preston Feight

Well, Steve, it's good to talk to you. Thanks for the question. I'd start by saying being full for 2023 right now is a great place to be operating from. The markets continue to be healthy for us around the world, and what we see is that we have great conversations going on with our customers, and so we're having great conversations around what the trucks are going to be and their order needs are going to be for next year. There are some sectors out there that are exceptionally good. That's LTL, vocational and otherwise, and demand is expected to be strong.

Stephen Edward Volkmann

Okay. Maybe I'll pivot again on '24. But if '24 were to be a down year in any amount, you talked about sort of structurally higher margins, I'm curious how you guys think the decremental margins would look if there was a decrement.

R. Preston Feight

Well, Steve, you know we don't provide 2024 guidance on this call. I think you do hit up on a really good point, though, which is the structural improvements of PACCAR compared to a few years ago are significant, right? The product investments we've made; industry-leading trucks we have in Europe that are significantly outperforming; the growth we have in South America, which is significant; the new medium-duty products in North America; and the fact that PACCAR Parts is doing such a great job with being a high-margin, high-growth, technology-driven transportation solutions provider for our customers, all of those things contribute to a great future.

Operator

Our next question is from Tami Zakaria from JPMorgan.

Tami Zakaria

So my first question is, since your order books are full for this year, like you said, you probably have visibility into fourth quarter deliveries as well. So should the fourth quarter deliveries be sequentially better than the third quarter or possibly the highest delivery quarter of the year? Or how should we think about 4Q versus 3Q?

R. Preston Feight

Yes. What I would think about is the second half, Tami, and the second half being a strong second half with the full backlog. You have some differences in the markets in Q3 and Q4 and Q3 in Europe has summer shutdowns. So that affects things. In North America in Q4, there's more holidays as well. But in general, we will be trying to increase build. We still continue to look at the market as being somewhat constrained in terms of supply base. That periodically affects us and everyone else, and so that may have a pacing item on the deliveries in Q4.

Tami Zakaria

Got it. And then can you comment on what was the price realization for trucks and parts in the second quarter? And do you expect price realization to sequentially decline in the back half?

R. Preston Feight

I'll let Harrie kind of talk about that one.

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers

Pricing for trucks in the second quarter was up 15%. We saw significant cost increases still in the order of magnitude of 9% for trucks. And then for parts, cost increases were a little higher, but more than offset by price increases for parts of around 13%.

Tami Zakaria

Any comments on the back half pricing outlook?

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers

No, with all the new products and the structural improvements that Preston just explained, I think we're in a good position to maintain our pricing discipline.

R. Preston Feight

I think Harrie shared that we expect margins of 18% to 19% in Q3, and I think that's kind of a testament of how we see the price cost analysis's going.

Operator

Our next question is from Chad Dillard from Bernstein.

Charles Albert Edward Dillard

As you look -- as you think about price cost over the next 12 months and also contemplate the pullback we've seen in raw material costs, do you think the market is strong enough for you to actually increase that price cost spread? Or do you think you'll need to give some back to understand how you're thinking about managing that balance?

R. Preston Feight

I guess we don't spend as much time thinking about it in those terms. We continue to think about it in terms of the relationships we have with our customers, the strength of the product performance and the value that provides to the customer. Like as we've shared before, the new trucks are providing at least 7% improvement in fuel economy, which is bringing thousands and thousands of dollars of benefit to our customers, the trucks that these drivers want. And so I think our customers make a good decision around trying to buy the best product for their operations, which are PACCAR's products, and that gives us a good pricing position as a premium brand in the market.
Cost. Well, cost is something that you get to follow as much as us, and we look at the world around us and see some movement in costs in positive ways and still labor pressures on the other side of it. So it's a little bit ambiguous.

Charles Albert Edward Dillard

Got it. Okay. And just second question. So there are some industry forecasts are calling for something on the order of like a 15% cut of production in the coming year, and I'm certainly not holding it to that. But how should we think about your ability to grow your Parts business in such an environment?

R. Preston Feight

I think the Parts business is growing for several reasons. One is it's because our ability to get parts to our customers in the same day or next day has changed a lot. So we are the desired place to go for parts for people. I think the application of technology by our team has been an enabler as well, like we make sure that our dealers have the right parts that they need and support. And I think that understanding our customers' needs is how we think about it. So parts is really a transportation solutions provider, which makes them the go-to source for customers. And we think we're the leader in that space, and that helps us grow the business through all parts of the coming years.

Operator

Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research.

Robert Cameron Wertheimer

Just a mechanical question on how you typically open orders for the year forward. Are you still holding back at all just on containing other uncertainty? And then a real market-based question on vocational trucks, whether you expect or have already seen some of the strength that may come with the infrastructure bill or general construction appearing there and whether there are any constraints on that market growth from body building or other capacity issues?

R. Preston Feight

Yes. So the first question on how we think about the order book, we have close relationships with our customers, and those relationships carry on all the time. So some customers want to place orders already and want multiyear orders, and we deal with those customers on a case-by-case basis. We try not to get ahead of ourselves in general pricing release before we understand what the world is going to look like a little bit in 2024. So the next quarter or so, that will start to free up. 
In terms of the vocational market, think about that, it is exceptionally strong right now. There is a limitation on -- from the bodybuilder standpoint. They're trying to build as many bodies as they can. We're building as many vocational trucks as we can, and we think we're at the beginning of that. So we think that, that will continue for quite some time as investments into America are continuing.

Operator

Our next question today comes from David Raso from Evercore ISI.

David Michael Raso

The Parts business, the third quarter, the up 7% midpoint, I'm just trying to get a sense of the volume baked in. The first quarter, right, pricing was up 15% in Parts. You had a little bit of currency drag, so volumes were up a little. The second quarter, given that price comment, I'm not sure volume was up at all in Parts. The third quarter, I'm just giving you a sense of the volume. Are the volumes assumed down in the third quarter year-over-year and then you have the price to get back to 7% total?

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers

So the 6% to 8% growth in the third quarter, what you have to take into account, David, is that last year, we saw very strong growth in Parts, especially in the third quarter. And with this 6% to 8% growth, we expect the year to be 10% to 13% higher than last year, which is excellent and above our long-term average.

David Michael Raso

Okay. So that implies the fourth quarter is up only similar to the third. But again, I know it's tough comp, just so I kind of understand the volume/price issue. Is the slowdown mostly volume going a bit negative? Or is there something about the pricing? I'm just trying to understand that cadence between volume and price so I can better understand how to model the margins.

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers

I wouldn't call it a slowdown that, David. I think the parts business is growing 6% to 8% in the quarter, 10% to 13% for the year. That's an excellent performance by the entire PACCAR Parts team.

David Michael Raso

Yes, I'm not refuting. I'm just trying to get a sense of the volume versus price that you're thinking about the rest of the year. That's all. In the up 7%, is that all price? Or is it volume down and price up to more than negate the volume decline? I'm just trying to get that split.

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers

Sure. Of course, it's a combination of volume and price.

R. Preston Feight

Yes. If you're trying to get it in the macro, David, maybe you could look at it and say like there was a lot of pent-up pressure for parts and getting inventories right into people's businesses, dealerships, customers. I think some of that has been met on the parts side of the business, not on the truck side really. And now that's kind of the flow that we're looking at going forward.

David Michael Raso

That's fair. Okay. So you're just sort of normalizing the parts after heavy last year kind of stocking. And then by the end of the year, you're hopefully balance here on the parts? Is that sort of the idea?

R. Preston Feight

I guess we say it differently. And as Harrie said, I think aptly that you see the growth being steady growth over the full year. with just a 6% to 8% third quarter in it. And then growth again next year. So the business is doing tremendously well.

David Michael Raso

Okay. And one follow-up. On the order books for '24, are we looking to do that a quarter or 6 months at a time like we've done recently? Or more return to a more traditional open up for the full year?

R. Preston Feight

I think what we'll do is we'll look at the first part of the year and decide what the first part of the year looks like and release like that as we get into the general pricing.

Operator

Our next question is from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse.

Jamie Lyn Cook

I guess just 2 questions. One, I know you're full on production for 2023, and that's limited to some degree by supply chain constraints still. Can you talk to sort of where delivery for the year or in the back half, if supply chain was back to more normalized levels? I'm wondering potentially, is that a tailwind to 2024? I mean if markets -- if supply chain gets back to normal share because we've underserved the market?
And then my second question, can you just give -- I know you had some nice market share gains in South America. Could you just give a broad view on what your market share is relative to the order book if it's improved and sort of what markets potentially next year? And down -- assuming the downturn happened, where would be the biggest opportunity for PACCAR to gain market share?

R. Preston Feight

So the first part of your question, Jamie, good talking with you, is really around -- I do think that the supply constraints continue at some modest level, and that modest level does provide a tailwind to the market in 2024. I agree with you. 
I think on the second side of your question, I don't know. Maybe Harrie has thoughts on it or something like that. But...

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers

Well, I think market share, we've been building as many trucks in the first half of this year as we can around the world, and so market share is a result of that. And yes, we've seen strong market share growth in South America. We expect further growth opportunities there. Market shares in North America and Europe have had a slow start of the year. But as we progress during the year, we expect growth opportunities across the world.

R. Preston Feight

Yes. To add into it, I would say like our build percentage is increasing. And as our build percentage increases, which has been supply-constrained, then our market share grows. And we see nothing but strong demand for the products. So it's really just about being to associate that demand, and that's just going to take us some time to get the build out.

Operator

Our next question today is from Steven Fisher from UBS.

Steven Fisher

So within your 18% to 19% Q3 gross margin forecast, can you just help us with some of the underlying factors there? I assume the European shutdown will be a headwind. So does that mean kind of mix of parts versus trucks is a tailwind that offsets that? Or the mix from new models is still a tailwind? What -- or are there other factors to consider? Maybe you could just help us with a little bit of buildup of how that kind of stays in that range.

R. Preston Feight

I think it's pretty steady performance between parts and trucks in Q3 from Q2, which I think kind of lays into what we're seeing in the market, which is a strong market with strong performance. And that's happening on the truck and parts side, and we see that continuing.

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers

I would echo that. If I look at the third quarter, it's probably just a continuation of what we've seen in the second quarter.

Steven Fisher

Okay. That's helpful. And then you had in the release about the expansion of Chillicothe. I guess in terms of capacity needs, how are you planning for 2025 and 2026. There's some talk about this being sort of a record North American up cycle. How are you thinking about that? And how do you think the rest of the supply chain is preparing for this? Are there going to be kind of capacity strength if this demand cycle plays out with that prebuy as people are thinking?

R. Preston Feight

Yes. I would say that what we're doing in Chillicothe is what we do all the time, which is making investments into our facilities to increase capacity and efficiencies. It's just a good example of it in Chillicothe, and that 105,000 square foot building expansion we did there just helps us get more product out and even increases the level of high quality to a next level-up. 
From a build-out standpoint, that's just what we do. Like I said, we're doing it there. We're making investments in Columbus. We're making investments in Mexico. Really all around the world in South America. So we see the growth of PACCAR in the long term, and so we want to make sure that we're prepared for that with the factories.
From a supply base standpoint, we have great suppliers. We work closely with them to make sure that they have the capacity Obviously, they've had unusual circumstances in the past couple of years. I'd expect some normalization there, and we'll continue to work closely with them to make sure that they can provide the product we need.

Operator

Our next question today comes from Tim Thein from Citigroup.

Timothy W. Thein

Preston, it's just, I guess, yet another one on the parts business, and I think this will be a North American focus. But I'm just curious if you listen to some of the public truckload companies that have reported. I mean they've seen some pretty -- a lot of pressure just in terms of utilization and pressure on profitability. I'm just curious, a lot of the discussion was just on positive messaging that you're kind of conveying. But any warning signs that you're seeing or hearing from either your large fleet customers or your dealers in terms of sometimes when you get pressure on profitability, you may get some maintenance intervals that get pushed out or rebuild? Did that get extended or what have you? I'm just curious if there's been any sign of that. Or is it just they're chugging right through that and it's -- the business is not feeling that? I'm just curious what's kind of real time what you're hearing from the team specific to your truckload customers.

R. Preston Feight

Great question. Good to think about it in that broad term. I think from a truckload carrier standpoint, you heard their comments in their earnings calls, as have we, and in our relationships with them, and they've come through. I think a tough few months for them in terms of utilization and rates, but they also kind of will say that there may be a seed the bottom of it, and things are starting to show signs of improvement in that truckload carrier. 
But that's not the whole market. We also see the LTL market continuing to be strong, and we see the vocational market continuing to be strong, as well as medium duty. So from a total business standpoint, we see this steady, strong position that we're in, and we expect that to continue. And then that may even be aided as the truckload carriers see improvement in their businesses in the coming quarters.

Timothy W. Thein

Got it. Okay. And that makes sense. And then just within your truck order board within the backlog, is there -- historically, PACCAR, again, more North American-oriented question. But pretty well balanced, certainly at least against some of your OEM peers across small-, mid-, large-sized fleets. Is the order board and kind of the how the deliveries have played out, are you seeing more -- has that shifted more towards your big large fleets or, I guess, your large fleet this year? And what do you think about the investment appetite for your small to midsized carriers as you think about '24?

R. Preston Feight

I think of it -- I think it's more representative of the first way you kind of came at the market through the vocational and truckload and over-the-road carriers versus vocational rather than the small, mid, large. I think that there's variance within that small, mid, large sector.

Operator

Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank.

Nicole Sheree DeBlase

Maybe just starting with your 3Q delivery outlook, down at the midpoint a little bit Q-on-Q. Is that 100% driven by European holidays, so you're effectively projecting U.S. production flat to up in the third quarter?

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers

That is correct, Nicole. And Europe has a 3-week summer shutdown every year. It takes 3 weeks of production out. And some of that is offset by higher production in all the parts of the world.

Nicole Sheree DeBlase

Okay. Okay. Understood. And then in the spirit of the expanded relationship with Toyota on the hydrogen fuel cell side, can you just talk a little bit about the level of customer demand that you're actually hearing for hydrogen fuel cell trucks at this point?

R. Preston Feight

Yes. That's -- it's a great question. It's one that the customers are trying to understand the choices out in front of them, right? With the regulations coming, they'd like to know whether they're going to be using clean diesel, whether hydrogen infrastructure is going to develop, whether they can use hydrogen combustion, hydrogen fuel cells or battery electric. It seems like it will be some combination of both for a while or some -- all of the above for a while. And so I think there is quite a bit of an interest on behalf of Peterbilt and Kenworth and the Toyota fuel cell project, and we've got strong inquiries and orders for that already. And I would expect people will explore that. Obviously, they're trying to balance this total cost of ownership for all the different technologies, and it's early days, and I think that they're trying to learn right now more than they're trying to convert.

Operator

Our next question is from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.

Jerry David Revich

Preston, I wonder if I could ask, your profit per truck now stands at $18,000 in prior cycles. It hasn't gotten above $10,000. Can you just talk about what's driven that acceleration? Because you've always had the premium brand in the market, it feels like you're getting a higher return on the incremental fuel efficiency improvements in automation. I'm wondering if you could just maybe help us understand how much of that improvement is those areas versus improved competitive discipline and how are you thinking about opportunities from here on the next set of product development platforms that you folks have set up on the road map.

R. Preston Feight

Sure. Thanks for the question. I do think that what the investments we've made over the past several years are paying off. and they're paying off in a bunch of different markets. So they're paying off in the fact that within DAF in Europe, we have the only truck that complies with mass and dimensions is fully compliant with that. It provides great aerodynamic benefit, great driver benefit we're able to sell it at a higher price and provide better profitability for ourselves because the customers get a benefit in that fuel economy. Similarly, at Kenworth and Peterbilt, the new T680 and 579 are doing a great job of providing the industry's leading fuel economy for our customers. And then the new medium-duty products that we launched give us a different level of profitability in the medium-duty space and customer benefits as well. So all of those things kind of are taking our profitability to a structurally-improved level. And South America, I should add, is also a business growth area for us where that's contributing. So we see that these are sustainable, long-term advantages.
And then to the second part of your question about future. Well, we couldn't be more excited than we are about the investments we have going forward. There's a whole suite of things that we're working on right now that I think will just continue to set the standard in terms of premium trucks and transportation solutions.

Jerry David Revich

Super. And then from an SG&A standpoint, any one-off pieces in the quarter? Really interesting to see SG&A down as much as it was sequentially and flat year-over-year given the top line growth, how should we be thinking about the SG&A leverage off of this 2Q base?

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers

We continue to control our SG&A expenses very tightly. That's how we run the business. So we've seen some increases here and there, but it's offset by being more efficient elsewhere and, a very controlled SG&A spending level going forward is what you're going to expect from us.

Jerry David Revich

And then just last one. In the prepared remarks, you spoke about the new facilities improving, dealer on-time deliveries and ability to stock. Where do dealer inventories of your A runners stand today versus a year ago? Is it fair to assume service levels are up versus a year ago and inventories are up at your dealers' level for the high-volume runners.

R. Preston Feight

Yes, I think that that's -- it's a fair observation that a year ago, things were pretty tight and constrained in terms of parts inventory, and that's been maybe ameliorated to some percentage. So that's helping people get their service done in a more quick way. which is good for our customers, which is what we're always out for.

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers

And parts inventories have gone up, of course, as we sell more. Net-net, inventory turns were at record levels in the second quarter. So continue to have the inventory that we need to satisfy our customers.

R. Preston Feight

And it's helped us as we grow our overall share of the Parts business.

Operator

Our next question is from Matt Elkott from Cowen & Co.

Matthew Youssef Elkott

Just a quick follow-up on Europe. You guys obviously have a technology advantage over the last few quarters there. But is the outlook in Europe primarily driven by technology? Because the European economy does face some challenges broadly, and that's being reflected in freight at times, at least on the intermodal side -- on the revenue intermodal side.

R. Preston Feight

I think what you're saying is that you can imagine the European economy has maybe -- has felt like the mouth kilometers are down a little bit year-over-year, and we recognize that. But we do think that the new truck is performing so well that that's to our advantage in Europe.

Matthew Youssef Elkott

Okay. And then follow -- another follow-up on the hydrogen side with Toyota fuel cell. You guys have been somewhat of the opinion that hydrogen, ICE engines could be one of the most viable bridges to whatever technology we coalesce around long term. Do you still think that? Or is the Toyota fuel cell partnership, does it market that change?

R. Preston Feight

No, I think that we do still think it can be a solution. I think that it depends upon regulatory allowance. Like in Europe, hydrogen ICE is allowed as a zero emissions product. That's not determined yet in the North American space. It has to be still discussed with the agencies. Again, we think that there is efficiencies of fuel cells and different efficiencies with hydrogen ICE and different ones for battery electric. So I think it's important that we explore and work through all of those and see what are up with the best total cost of ownership is for our customers because that's really what we're driving for. And that's the level of the conversation right now. And we think it's a bit early to make a call on which one is going to be right. We do think that diesel engines will be a significant part of that for the years to come.

Matthew Youssef Elkott

Got it. And then just one final clarification. I know supply chain disruptions have eased generally in recent quarters. But is there a way to gauge how far we still are from pre-COVID levels? And if you guys see a line of sight into getting back to those levels next year.

R. Preston Feight

I don't know if there's a way to gauge it. I would say the suppliers are doing a pretty good job of trying to work through it as quickly as they can and trying to increase their capacity and meet the -- satisfy the market. Nobody wants to do it more than them or us. And so together, we're working through that. And I keep seeing this improvement. It's far better than it was a couple of quarters ago, and we expect it will be better in the quarters to come.

Operator

Our next question is from Jeff Kauffman from Vertical Research Partners.

Jeffrey Asher Kauffman

Just wanted to get -- already on one item, and then I want to go back to the Zero emission vehicles and a follow-up there. For PACCAR Financial, it looks like the fleet was up about 2%, but assets were up about 6% versus first quarter. Could you help me understand that differential?

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers

The average sales prices of trucks have gone up quite a bit over the last couple of years. We said earlier during the call, in the second quarter, pricing was at 15%. So even with 2% growth in the total fleet for PACCAR Financial, the total assets grow with the higher prices per truck as well, of course.

Jeffrey Asher Kauffman

All right. And secondly, talking about the new emission vehicles, I had a chance to see the new truck at ACT Expo. And I was asking, ""Well, are people putting in orders? And when would you deliver the market?"" And I was told, ""Oh, yes, you can put it in order today, but we're probably looking at a 2025-ish timeframe."" And I just want to kind of follow up on that. The electric vehicle push was aggressive. It feels like some folks are pulling back over challenge the charging infrastructure and what have you. You answered the earlier question what are you seeing on fuel cell. But can you give us an idea of when that truck is likely to be available? And maybe kind of update what's going on with customers on the battery electric side?

R. Preston Feight

Well, sure, happy to do that. So 2024 is when we think we'll be putting fuel cell trucks out there with the Toyota project. So that's -- we've already done 11 of them in the market. That was our first fleets that we did last year, and now we're kind of just finishing up what will be a higher volume run. We expect that to be in the hundreds still. It's kind of what I would expect on the fuel cell level.
Your comments on people pulling back or not, we see still strong interest on EV, battery electric EV, but there is an infrastructure thing that needs to be worked through as a society. What our position is, is PACCAR will have the best products, whether they're battery electric, diesel, hydrogen fuel cell, hygiene combustion. We'll have that entire suite available, and then we'll be ready for the market. So we work closely with the regulatory agencies to support them and work with our customers to support them and puts us in a great position for the future. We could not be more excited about the kinds of technologies and what that does for PACCAR's future and how we'll perform.

Our next question is from Michael Feniger from Bank of America..

Michael J. Feniger

Preston, are you seeing anything in the truck market in terms of the way freight moves or your customers' purchasing patterns that maybe suggest a normal traditional replacement cycle? It's higher than what we've observed historically. Are fleet operators trying to keep a younger fleet? Or any other trends that maybe what we normally think is replacement demand if the market returns there it's actually higher given some changes in the freight and the transportation market?

R. Preston Feight

You're right. I do think it will be higher than maybe people used to think of it. But more importantly to me is the fact that the trucks that are being produced, specifically by PACCAR are providing operating cost advantages, which helps people want to renew their fleet at a sooner level. If you get a 7% benefit in fuel economy from a new Peterbilt or Kenworth or a DAF in Europe, the value is so high that you just want to replace the truck, plus the driver satisfaction is higher, and it's just a good business decision. So I think we see those turns happening more frequently.

Michael J. Feniger

Helpful. And you mentioned earlier in the call how used truck values have moderated, yet still high on a historical basis. Do you find the spread between new truck pricing and your used truck pricing wider than normal? Or is the moderation in used truck values more of just a normalization of production? Curious how you're kind of seeing that used values playing out in the second half of this year.

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers

Talk about normalization of used truck prices. If we compare back to a year ago, used truck prices were extremely high and probably not even healthy for the market. I think in the meantime, used truck prices have come down to very normal levels. And our company, it's the finance company that sells the used trucks. And we've built out a network of 13 used truck centers that help us to sell more used trucks to retail customers at a premium price. So even at a slightly moderated used truck pricing levels, the finance company continues to do well and is able to sell the used trucks that we get back at profit levels.

Operator

Microchip Technology Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Microchip Technology Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise

Microchip Technology Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Microchip Technology Incorporated Quote

Microchip’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 1.38% on average.

Let’s see how things have shaped up for the company prior to this announcement:

Factors to Consider

Microchip is riding on consistent strength in its analog and mixed-signal microcontroller businesses. It is expected to have gained from the dominance of its 8, 16 and 32-bit microcontrollers in the fiscal first quarter.

Mixed-signal microcontrollers represented 58% of the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues.

Our model estimates fiscal first-quarter mixed-signal microcontrollers revenues of $1.29 billion, indicating 21.2% year-over-year growth.

Microchip’s fiscal first-quarter results are expected to benefit from strong industrial, automotive, aerospace and defense, and data center end markets. Nevertheless, weakness in the consumer end market is expected to have hurt its top-line growth.

Moreover, raging inflation and higher interest rates are expected to have hurt profitability.

What Our Model Says

Per the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.

Microchip has an Earnings ESP of -2.19% and a Zacks Rank #3, currently. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

This article aims to answer this query, offering an in-depth valuation analysis of Microchip Technology. We invite you to explore the financial details and insights that follow.

A Snapshot of Microchip Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MCHP)

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with MCHP. Click here to check it out.  MCHP 30-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of MCHP

Microchip Technology became an independent company in 1989 when it was spun off from General Instrument. Over half of the company's revenue comes from MCUs, which are utilized in a wide array of electronic devices, from remote controls to garage door openers to power windows in autos. The company's strength lies in lower-end 8-bit MCUs suitable for a broader range of less technologically advanced devices. However, the firm has expanded its presence in higher-end MCUs and analog chips as well.

With a stock price of $91.65 and a GF Value of $91.75, Microchip Technology appears to be fairly valued. This conclusion is based on an intricate blend of the company's financial data and historical trends. Here's a look at the income breakdown of Microchip Technology: Is Microchip Technology (MCHP) Fairly Valued? An In-depth GF Value Analysis

Understanding the GF Value of Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP)

The GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the intrinsic value of a stock. It is derived from historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded.

Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) appears to be fairly valued based on the GuruFocus valuation method. This assessment is based on historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. Conversely, if the share price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued and have higher future returns. At its current price of $91.65 per share, Microchip Technology stock appears to be fairly valued.

Microchip Technology's Financial Strength

Investing in companies with poor financial strength poses a higher risk of permanent capital loss. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully review a company's financial strength before deciding to buy its stock. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage is an excellent starting point for understanding a company's financial strength. Microchip Technology has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.04, which is worse than 97.8% of companies in the Semiconductors industry. GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of Microchip Technology at 6 out of 10, indicating that the financial strength of Microchip Technology is fair.

Profitability and Growth of Microchip Technology

Investing in profitable companies carries less risk, especially in companies that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term. Typically, a company with high profit margins offers better performance potential than a company with low profit margins. Microchip Technology has been profitable 10 years over the past 10 years. During the past 12 months, the company had revenues of $8.4 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $4.01. Its operating margin of 36.88% is better than 95.84% of companies in the Semiconductors industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks Microchip Technology's profitability as strong.

Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. The faster a company is growing, the more likely it is to be creating value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of Microchip Technology is 13.7%, which ranks better than 55.01% of companies in the Semiconductors industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 26.9%, which ranks better than 55.71% of companies in the Semiconductors industry.

ROIC vs WACC: Evaluating Profitability

One can also evaluate a company's profitability by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the return on invested capital exceeds the weighted average cost of capital, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. During the past 12 months, Microchip Technology's ROIC is 15.74 while its WACC came in at 11.

The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Microchip Technology is shown below: Is Microchip Technology (MCHP) Fairly Valued? An In-depth GF Value Analysis

2023-07-22T11:00:41+00:00,Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) Knows How To Allocate Capital Effectively,"If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Autodesk's (NASDAQ:ADSK) look very promising so lets take a look.

What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?

If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Autodesk:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.20 = US$1.0b ÷ (US$9.1b - US$3.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).

Therefore, Autodesk has an ROCE of 20%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Software industry average of 9.4%.

In the above chart we have measured Autodesk's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our freereport for Autodesk.

How Are Returns Trending?

The fact that Autodesk is now generating some pre-tax profits from its prior investments is very encouraging. Shareholders would no doubt be pleased with this because the business was loss-making five years ago but is is now generating 20% on its capital. In addition to that, Autodesk is employing 150% more capital than previously which is expected of a company that's trying to break into profitability. We like this trend, because it tells us the company has profitable reinvestment opportunities available to it, and if it continues going forward that can lead to a multi-bagger performance.

On a side note, Autodesk's current liabilities are still rather high at 43% of total assets. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks.

Our Take On Autodesk's ROCE

To the delight of most shareholders, Autodesk has now broken into profitability. And investors seem to expect more of this going forward, since the stock has rewarded shareholders with a 60% return over the last five years. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.

While Autodesk looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price. The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether ADSK is currently trading for a fair price.

Kraft Heinz is on track with strategic pricing efforts to counter increasing input costs. Higher list prices have been fueling its top-line growth. We expect favorable pricing growth of 7.5% on the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.

The company has been benefiting from the strength of its operating model and solid transformation efforts, as part of which it has been on track with AGILE@SCALE to accelerate profit and enhance shareholders' value. The strategy has been helping Kraft Heinz enhance its agile expertise and capabilities via partnerships with technology giants and cutting-edge innovators.

Yet, Kraft Heinz has been grappling with the rising inflationary environment for a while. In its last earnings call, management expects high-single-digit inflation in 2023, including low-double-digit inflation in the first half. This raises concerns for the second quarter of 2023.

2023-07-31T13:00:00+00:00,Kraft Heinz Announces Goal to Reduce the Use of Virgin Plastic Globally by 20 Percent – or more than 100 Million Pounds – by 2030,"Company aims to reach goal by using less plastic, more recycled content, and alternatives to plastic

PITTSBURGH & CHICAGO, July 31, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Kraft Heinz Company (Nasdaq: KHC) (the ""Company"" or ""Kraft Heinz"") announces a new goal in 2023 to reduce the use of virgin plastic in its global packaging portfolio by 20 percent by 2030 – a critical step in decreasing its use of fossil fuels and finding more sustainable product packaging options. This change is estimated to reduce the use of approximately 100 million pounds of virgin plastic1, the equivalent of nearly five Eiffel Towers in weight.

This goal builds on the existing investments the Company has made across its portfolio to reduce plastic use and meet its broader packaging goals, including aiming to make 100 percent recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging by 2025, and aiming to reach net-zero greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions by 2050, while halving emissions by 2030.

""To achieve our ESG goals, including to reach net-zero GHG emissions, we can’t continue to do things as we have in the past,"" said Rashida La Lande, Executive Vice President, Global General Counsel, and Chief Sustainability and Corporate Affairs Officer at Kraft Heinz. ""We are investing in innovative technologies and partnerships that are critical to helping us redesign packaging, eliminate unnecessary plastic, increase our use of recycled content, and influence the adoption of reuse models. This is one more way we’re renovating our product portfolio to not only offer more sustainable options, but to deliver on our consumer expectations.""

Replacing Virgin Plastic with Recycled Content

Kraft Heinz is building on the existing work with the U.S., Canada, and U.K. Plastic Pacts to increase the use of recycled content in its packaging. The Company targets replacing 15 percent of its U.S. PET rigid plastic packaging portfolio with post-consumer recycled content by 2025.

KRAFT® Real Mayo and MIRACLE WHIP® plan to transition packaging to 100 percent recycled content in the United States beginning in 2024 in an effort to eliminate approximately 14 million pounds of virgin plastic. HEINZ® moved to 30 percent recycled content in most of its bottles in Brazil, the U.K., and Europe. HEINZ partnered with specialists in the U.K. to create recyclable HEINZ Beans Snap Pots from soft plastics that were returned to Tesco by consumers. The recyclable pots are food-safe and made with 39 percent recycled plastic.

Material Elimination or Reduction

Kraft Heinz is identifying packaging solutions that use less plastic, such as eliminating unnecessary plastic components.

SHAKE ‘N BAKE® removed its plastic ""shaker"" bag from its signature packaging last year to help eliminate 900,000 pounds of plastic waste annually. Effective across its full product portfolio, this was the brand’s first step toward a more sustainable future and an easy way for consumers to make a difference. HEINZ launched an eco-friendly multipack paperboard sleeve to replace plastic shrink-wrap in the U.K., eliminating more than 1 million pounds of plastic in 2022.

Exploring Material Alternatives

Kraft Heinz is also exploring the use of alternative materials like fiber-based packaging with the hope that these cutting-edge innovations could be used for other packaging formats in years to come.

HEINZ announced a pilot with Pulpex in 2022 to develop a paper-based, renewable and recyclable bottle made from 100 percent sustainably sourced wood pulp for HEINZ Tomato Ketchup – a first in the sauce category. The Company is currently testing the prototype to assess performance before bringing the bottle to the market. NABOB® coffee in Canada replaced its non-recyclable flexible plastic coffee bags with recyclable canisters made from 80 percent paper fiber from renewable resources this year. This change is estimated to eliminate approximately 2.5 million plastic bags annually.

Driven by our Company Value We do the right thing, Kraft Heinz is dedicated to minimizing its operational footprint and leaving a positive impact on the environment. These solutions serve as a catalyst for what’s to come in the years ahead as the Company aims to accelerate innovation and growth through partnerships.

2023-07-27T14:00:53+00:00,Is IDEXX Laboratories (NASDAQ:IDXX) Using Too Much Debt?,"Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We can see that IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDXX) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?

When Is Debt A Problem?

Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.

See our latest analysis for IDEXX Laboratories

What Is IDEXX Laboratories's Net Debt?

The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that IDEXX Laboratories had US$1.20b in debt in March 2023; about the same as the year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$111.4m, its net debt is less, at about US$1.09b. debt-equity-history-analysis

A Look At IDEXX Laboratories' Liabilities

According to the last reported balance sheet, IDEXX Laboratories had liabilities of US$1.07b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$901.7m due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$111.4m as well as receivables valued at US$519.9m due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$1.34b.

Since publicly traded IDEXX Laboratories shares are worth a very impressive total of US$46.2b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.

We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.

IDEXX Laboratories has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 1.0. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 20.8 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. IDEXX Laboratories's EBIT was pretty flat over the last year, but that shouldn't be an issue given the it doesn't have a lot of debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine IDEXX Laboratories's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.

But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, IDEXX Laboratories recorded free cash flow worth 65% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.

Our View

IDEXX Laboratories's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. We would also note that Medical Equipment industry companies like IDEXX Laboratories commonly do use debt without problems. Looking at the bigger picture, we think IDEXX Laboratories's use of debt seems quite reasonable and we're not concerned about it. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.  We've identified 2 warning signs  with IDEXX Laboratories , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt. Readers can access a list of growth stocks with zero net debt100% free, right now.

The company posted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.55 in the last reported quarter, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.14%. IDEXX Laboratories beat earnings estimates in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 5.15%.

Let’s look at how things have shaped up before this announcement.

Factors at Play

Companion Animal Group (CAG)

Similar to the first quarter, the CAG business is expected to have gained from consistent organic growth in CAG Diagnostics’ recurring revenues. Within the United States, we anticipate solid volume growth, backed by new business gains, sustained customer retention levels and continued increases in diagnostic frequency and utilization at the practice level. Further, in the second quarter, U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth might have outpaced sector growth trends.

IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise

IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. price-eps-surprise | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Quote

In international regions, the segment is likely to have benefited from key execution drivers, including the benefits of higher price realization, solid new business gains and the expansion of the premium instrument base. However, these benefits are likely to have been moderated by the impacts of challenging global macro conditions, which continued to put pressure on same-store volume growth trends in the last reported quarter.

We anticipate IDEXX to have achieved solid organic gains across its testing modalities in the second quarter. IDEXX VetLab consumables revenues are likely to have increased in the United States and international regions. Similar to the last quarter, gains are expected to have been supported by year-over-year growth in its global premium instrument installed base across the company’s Catalyst, Premium Hematology and SediVue platforms.

Further, the worldwide placements of the ProCyte One hematology analyzer are likely to have sustained its growth momentum in the to-be-reported quarter. On the first-quarter earnings call, the company’s management noted that the installed base of this new piece of technology has more than doubled over the last year to 9,400 units.

In the second quarter, global rapid assay organic revenues are likely to have been driven by strong growth in the United States, backed by solid volume gains and the benefits of higher net price realization. Global lab revenues are expected to have witnessed strong gains in the United States. Internationally, growth in key regions is likely to have been moderated by macroeconomic impacts, pressuring same-store sales.

In terms of other areas of the CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues are likely to have improved in the second quarter, banking on continued high levels of organic growth in recurring software and digital imaging revenues and continued strong momentum in cloud-based software placements.

Our model projects revenues from the CAG segment for the second quarter to be $833.3 million, suggesting an improvement of 6.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.

Water

In the second quarter, IDEXX’s Water business is likely to have delivered impressive organic revenues in the United States, Europe and Latin America. On the first-quarter earnings call, management noted that progress made in the integration and performance of the recent Tecta-PDS acquisition has expanded IDXX’s capabilities in water safety testing.

Per our model, projected revenues from this segment for the second quarter stand at $42.3 million, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 7.8%.

Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD)

The segment is likely to have witnessed solid organic gains in the United States and Europe in the second quarter. However, in the last reported quarter, growth was offset by comparisons to high prior-year sales levels in herd health screening and reduced revenues from non-core food and safety products in certain regions.

Our model projects revenues from the LPD segment for the second quarter to be $32.3 million, suggesting an improvement of 8.1% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. We anticipate the company to have worked through these comparison impacts and have delivered positive growth in LPD in the second quarter.

Q2 Estimates

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IDEXX’s second quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $928 million, suggesting an increase of 7.8% from the year-ago reported figure.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its second quarter 2023 EPS of $2.43 indicates a 55.8% rise from the year-ago reported figure.

What Our Model Suggests

Per our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), along with a positive Earnings ESP, has a higher chance of beating estimates. However, that is not the case here, as you can see below:

A set of bullish initiatives including new facility openings, elevated salvage auction volumes, and an industry-leading digital offering in Copart Max have helped the stock resume its long-term upward trajectory. CPRT stock hit an all-time high earlier this month as stocks have entered a new bull market. Shares continue to display relative strength as buying pressure accumulates in this market leader.

CPRT sports the second-highest Zacks Growth Style Score of ‘B’, indicating further upside is likely based on favorable earnings and sales growth metrics.

By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.

Earnings Trends and Future Estimates

CPRT has built up an impressive earnings history, surpassing earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters. Back in May, the company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings of $0.72/share, a 16.13% surprise over the $0.62 consensus estimate. CPRT has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 5.61%.

The Dallas, Texas-based company primarily has two revenue streams: service revenue and purchased vehicles. Both earnings and revenues have grown steadily despite previous economic headwinds: Zacks Investment Research

For the current fiscal year, analysts have increased earnings estimates by 3.36% in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $2.46/share, reflecting potential growth of 10.31% relative to the prior year. Revenues are projected to climb 9.17% to $3.82 billion.

Let’s Get Technical

CPRT shares have advanced nearly 46% in the past year. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions. StockCharts

Notice how both the 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages are sloping up. The stock has been making a series of higher highs. With both strong fundamentals and technicals, CPRT is poised to continue its outperformance.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. As we know, Copart has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and CPRT continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run this year.

Bottom Line

Solid institutional buying should continue to provide a tailwind for the stock price. CPRT enjoys a dominant market position, along with a strong balance sheet and high liquidity. Increasing volume at recent breakout levels is another bullish sign for the stock.

Robust fundamentals combined with an appealing technical trend certainly justify adding shares to the mix. Backed by a leading industry group and impressive history of earnings beats, it’s not difficult to see why this company is a compelling investment. Investors would be wise to consider CPRT as a portfolio candidate.

2023-07-31T09:50:00+00:00,Copart and Cal-Maine Foods have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,"For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL – July 31, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Copart CPRT as the Bull of the Day and Cal-Maine Foods CALM as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Starbucks Corp. SBUX, Arhaus ARHS and Costco COST.

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:

Bull of the Day:

Copart, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), enjoys a dominant leadership position in the automotive auction market, commanding a roughly 40% market share. A set of bullish initiatives including new facility openings, elevated salvage auction volumes, and an industry-leading digital offering in Copart Max have helped the stock resume its long-term upward trajectory. CPRT stock hit an all-time high earlier this month as stocks have entered a new bull market. Shares continue to display relative strength as buying pressure accumulates in this market leader.

CPRT sports the second-highest Zacks Growth Style Score of 'B', indicating further upside is likely based on favorable earnings and sales growth metrics. The company is part of the Zacks Auction and Valuation Services industry group, which ranks in the top 1% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. It's not a coincidence that this group has been steadily outperforming this year.

Historical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock's price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. It's no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.

Company Description

Bear of the Day:

Cal-Maine Foods produces, packages, and distributes shell eggs. The company offers specialty shell eggs such as nutritionally enhanced, cage free, organic, and brown eggs under recognized brand names including Egg-Land's Best, Land O' Lakes, Farmhouse Eggs, and 4-Grain. CALM markets and sells its products to national and regional grocery store chains, club stores, independent supermarkets, and foodservice distributors. Cal-Maine Foods was founded in 1957 and is based in Ridgeland, MS.

The Zacks Rundown

CALM, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a component of the Zacks Agriculture – Products industry group, which ranks in the bottom 10% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months, just as it has throughout this year.

Candidates in the bottom tiers of industries can often be solid potential short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in a poorly-performing industry group, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult.

The odds are stacked against CALM, and the stock is agreeing with this notion. CALM shares experienced a climax top in December of last year and have been in a price downtrend ever since. The share price is hitting a series of lower lows and represents a compelling short opportunity as the stock continues to lag the major market indexes.

Deteriorating Outlook

Cal-Maine Foods has been on the receiving end of negative earnings estimate revisions as of late. For the current quarter (fiscal Q1), the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate sits at a loss of -$0.01/share, reflecting a -100.39% decline relative to the same quarter last year.

For the current fiscal year, analysts have also revised their EPS estimates downward by 13.93% in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is now $4.20/share, translating to negative growth of -72.94%. Falling earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. Negative growth year-over-year is the type of trend that bears like to see.

Technical Trend

As illustrated below, CALM stock is in a sustained downtrend. Notice how the stock has plunged below both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages signaled by the blue and red lines, respectively. The 50-day moving average has recently acted as resistance and shares are currently testing that level. The stock is making a series of lower lows, with no respite from the selling in sight. Also note how both moving averages have rolled over and are sloping down – another good sign for the bears.

While not the most accurate indicator, CALM stock has also experienced what is known as a 'death cross', wherein the stock's 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. CALM would have to make a serious move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock. The stock has fallen nearly 10% this year alone, widely underperforming the major indices.

Final Thoughts

A deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to hit new highs anytime soon. The fact that CALM is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. Falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock's downtrend.

Potential investors may want to give this stock the cold shoulder, or perhaps include it as part of a short or hedge strategy. Bulls will want to steer clear of CALM shares until the situation shows major signs of improvement.

What's In Store for Starbucks (SBUX) Earnings?

Starbucks Corp. is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Aug 1, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings beat of 15.6%.

Q3 Estimates

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 95 cents per share, indicating growth of 13.1% year over year. In the past 30 days, earnings estimates have witnessed downward revisions by 1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $9.3 billion, suggesting an increase of 14% from the year-ago quarter.

Factors to Note

SBUX's focus on improving customer experience with innovative new store designs and upgraded product offerings, and supply-chain efficiencies has been contributing to its top line. Focus on store growth and robust loyalty program adds to its growth. During fiscal 2023, it expects store count in the United States and China to grow approximately 3% and 13%, respectively.

Robust comparable sales growth is likely to have aided the company's top line in the quarter. Our model predicts North America and International sales growth to increase 9% and 9.1% year over year, respectively.

In third-quarter fiscal 2023, our model estimates North America and Channel Development sales to be $6,934.2 million and $541.4 million, up 14.5% and 12.9% year over year, respectively. Starbucks is gaining from a rise in transactions and average ticket growth. We expect international sales to improve 12.1% year over year to $1,776.8 million.

The ongoing inflationary pressure is likely to have hurt SBUX's margin. Its ingredients are witnessing a significant uptick in price since the last few quarters. Our model suggests adjusted operating margin to be 16.8%, flat year over year. Our model anticipates total operating expenses to be $4,969.4 million, up 15.7% from the prior-year quarter.

What the Zacks Model Unveils

Our proven model doesn't conclusively predict an earnings beat for Starbucks this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

Earnings ESP: Starbucks has an Earnings ESP (the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate) of -0.53%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

Zacks Rank: Starbucks currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.

Stocks Poised to Beat Estimates

Here are some stocks worth considering from the Zacks Retail-Wholesale space as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this season.

Arhaus currently has an Earnings ESP of +7.69% and sports a Zacks Rank #1. ARHS is expected to register a bottom-line decline when it reports second-quarter 2023 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings per share of 26 cents suggests a fall of 7.1% from the year-ago quarter. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Arhaus' top line is anticipated to rise year over year. The consensus mark is pegged at $325.7 million, indicating an increase of 6.3% from the year-ago quarter's reported figure. ARHS has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 82.4%, on average.

Costco currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.73% and a Zacks Rank of 3. COST is likely to register bottom-line growth while posting fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings per share of $4.73 indicates a 10.5% increase from the year-ago reported number.

Costco's top line is projected to ascend year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $78.85 billion, indicating 9.4% rise from the prior-year quarter. COST has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.8%, on average.

AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER

Preliminary, unaudited results Second Quarter ended June 30 Year-to-date ended June 30 2023 2022 Variance 2023 2022 Variance Revenue ($ in billions): 4.4 4.6 (0.2) 9.1 9.2 (0.1) Earnings ($ in millions): GAAP 521.2 524.5 (3.3) 918.2 1,239.2 (321.0) Operating (non-GAAP) 582.2 617.7 (35.5) 1,153.8 1,234.1 (80.3) EPS ($): GAAP 1.01 1.02 (0.01) 1.78 2.43 (0.65) Operating (non-GAAP) 1.13 1.20 (0.07) 2.24 2.42 (0.18) EPS based on 515 million shares 2Q 2023, 514 million shares 2Q 2022, 515 million shares YTD 2023 and 510 million shares YTD 2022.

American Electric Power (Nasdaq: AEP) today reported second-quarter 2023 earnings, prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), of $521 million or $1.01 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $525 million or $1.02 per share in second-quarter 2022. Operating earnings for second-quarter 2023 were $582 million or $1.13 per share, compared with operating earnings of $618 million or $1.20 per share in second-quarter 2022.

Operating earnings is a non-GAAP measure representing GAAP earnings excluding special items. The difference between 2023 GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter was largely due to the mark-to-market impact of economic hedging activities and recent legislation in Texas regarding recovery of certain employee incentives. A full reconciliation of GAAP earnings to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date is included in the tables at the end of this news release.

""AEP is committed to creating value for all our stakeholders as we invest $40 billion over the next five years in our energy delivery system and new generation resources. We made significant progress on our strategic objectives in the second quarter, executing on our regulated renewables and grid investment plans to benefit customers while working to keep rates affordable and supporting economic growth in our communities,"" said Julie Sloat, AEP president and chief executive officer.

""This quarter's results reflect the timing of higher interest and O&M expenses, as well as milder temperatures year over year. Our projections for the second half of the year are bolstered by our focus on cost discipline, efficiency and agility in operations to ensure we meet our stakeholder commitments. We are reaffirming our 2023 operating earnings guidance range of $5.19 to $5.39 per share and our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%.

""Residential and industrial load have slowed down as expected due to the impacts of inflation and rising interest rates on our customers. At the same time, we've had a significant increase in commercial load, which has grown almost 8 percent year over year in each of the last two quarters. This improvement is largely driven by our ongoing focus on economic development to bring growth and opportunity to our communities,"" Sloat said.

""We continue taking actions to de-risk and simplify our business. We expect to close on the sale of our 1,365-megawatt unregulated renewables portfolio to IRG Acquisition Holdings in August 2023 and are on track with the sales processes for the AEP Energy retail and AEP OnSite Partners distributed resources businesses as well as our 50% share in the New Mexico Renewable Development joint venture.

""We announced today that we'll be launching the sale of AEP's interests in two non-core transmission joint ventures, Prairie Wind and Pioneer. We plan to complete the previously announced strategic review of our Transource Energy joint venture by the end of the year. Our ongoing active management of the company strengthens our ability to prioritize investments in our regulated businesses to enhance service for customers while maintaining our commitment to credit quality,"" Sloat said.

""In the second quarter, we received regulatory approval to add nearly 2,000 megawatts of new wind and solar generation to help meet the projected power needs of customers in Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. We now have approvals in place for $5.2 billion of our five-year, $8.6 billion regulated renewables capital plan. We've filed for approval of $1.7 billion in additional renewable projects and have active RFPs for resources in other jurisdictions. We also continue to see positive earnings contributions from the transmission investments we're making to improve reliability and service for our customers,"" Sloat said.

AEP management reaffirmed its 2023 operating earnings guidance range of $5.19 to $5.39 per share. Operating earnings could differ from GAAP earnings for matters such as impairments, divestitures or changes in accounting principles. AEP management is not able to forecast if any of these items will occur or any amounts that may be reported for future periods. Therefore, AEP is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for earnings guidance.

Reflecting special items recorded through the second quarter, the estimated earnings per share on a GAAP basis would be $4.73 to $4.93 per share. See the table below for a full reconciliation of 2023 earnings guidance.

AEP's earnings are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and represent the company's earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company's operating earnings, a non-GAAP measure representing GAAP earnings excluding special items as described in the news release and charts, provide another representation for investors to evaluate the performance of the company's ongoing business activities. AEP uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement when communicating with analysts and investors regarding its earnings outlook and results. The company uses operating earnings data internally to measure performance against budget, to report to AEP's Board of Directors and also as an input in determining performance-based compensation under the company's employee incentive compensation plans.

American Electric Power, based in Columbus, Ohio, is powering a cleaner, brighter energy future for its customers and communities. AEP's approximately 17,000 employees operate and maintain the nation's largest electricity transmission system and more than 225,000 miles of distribution lines to safely deliver reliable and affordable power to 5.6 million regulated customers in 11 states. AEP also is one of the nation's largest electricity producers with approximately 30,000 megawatts of diverse generating capacity, including more than 7,000 megawatts of renewable energy. The company's plans include growing its renewable generation portfolio to approximately 50% of total capacity by 2032. AEP is on track to reach an 80% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 and has committed to achieving net zero by 2045. AEP is recognized consistently for its focus on sustainability, community engagement, and diversity, equity and inclusion. AEP's family of companies includes utilities AEP Ohio, AEP Texas, Appalachian Power (in Virginia and West Virginia), AEP Appalachian Power (in Tennessee), Indiana Michigan Power, Kentucky Power, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, and Southwestern Electric Power Company (in Arkansas, Louisiana, east Texas and the Texas Panhandle).

the impact of pandemics and any associated disruption of AEP's business operations due to impacts on economic or market conditions, costs of compliance with potential government regulations, electricity usage, supply chain issues, customers, service providers, vendors and suppliers; the economic impact of increased global trade tensions including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the adoption or expansion of economic sanctions or trade restrictions; inflationary or deflationary interest rate trends; volatility and disruptions in the financial markets precipitated by any cause, including failure to make progress on federal budget or debt ceiling matters, particularly developments affecting the availability or cost of capital to finance new capital projects and refinance existing debt; the availability and cost of funds to finance working capital and capital needs, particularly if expected sources of capital, such as proceeds from the sale of assets or subsidiaries, do not materialize, and during periods when the time lag between incurring costs and recovery is long and the costs are material; decreased demand for electricity; weather conditions, including storms and drought conditions, and AEP's ability to recover significant storm restoration costs; limitations or restrictions on the amounts and types of insurance available to cover losses that might arise in connection with natural disasters or operations;

the availability of fuel and necessary generation capacity and the performance of generation plants; AEP's ability to recover fuel and other energy costs through regulated or competitive electric rates; the ability to transition from fossil generation and the ability to build or acquire renewable generation, transmission lines and facilities (including the ability to obtain any necessary regulatory approvals and permits) when needed at acceptable prices and terms, including favorable tax treatment, and to recover those costs; new legislation, litigation and government regulation, including changes to tax laws and regulations, oversight of nuclear generation, energy commodity trading and new or heightened requirements for reduced emissions of sulfur, nitrogen, mercury, carbon, soot or particulate matter and other substances that could impact the continued operation, cost recovery, and/or profitability of generation plants and related assets; the impact of federal tax legislation on results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or credit ratings; the risks associated with fuels used before, during and after the generation of electricity and the byproducts and wastes of such fuels, including coal ash and spent nuclear fuel; timing and resolution of pending and future rate cases, negotiations and other regulatory decisions, including rate or other recovery of new investments in generation, distribution and transmission service and environmental compliance; resolution of litigation or regulatory proceedings or investigations; AEP's ability to constrain operation and maintenance costs; prices and demand for power generated and sold at wholesale; changes in technology, particularly with respect to energy storage and new, developing, alternative or distributed sources of generation; AEP's ability to recover through rates any remaining unrecovered investment in generation units that may be retired before the end of their previously projected useful lives; volatility and changes in markets for coal and other energy-related commodities, particularly changes in the price of natural gas; the impact of changing expectations and demands of customers, regulators, investors and stakeholders, including heightened emphasis on environmental, social and governance concerns; changes in utility regulation and the allocation of costs within regional transmission organizations, including ERCOT, PJM and SPP;

2023-07-31T09:34:27+00:00,3 Pharma Stocks to Buy for Their Promising Progress,"Identifying promising pharma stocks is no small feat in the dynamic and competitive realm of pharmaceuticals. The industry is replete with businesses boasting robust pipelines, each vying for a breakthrough that could potentially revolutionize healthcare.

Today’s article sheds light on three high-potential pharma stocks that hold strong promise for the future. These companies are among the cream of the crop regarding R&D pipeline size as of 2023, demonstrating a powerful blend of innovation and growth potential.

The journey towards significant medical advancements is akin to a marathon, where incremental progress can eventually lead to transformative therapies. This landscape offers compelling opportunities for investors willing to delve deeper. So, let’s explore these pharma stocks to watch, each armed with a powerful pipeline poised to shape the future of healthcare.

Promising Pharma Stocks: Pfizer (PFE)  Here's How Pfizer Stock (and Pharma) Stand to Benefit From Mylan Deal

Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com

Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is a renowned pharmaceutical business, viewed as an undervalued blue-chip stock with massive long-term growth potential. Further enhancing its appeal as an income stock is its attractive dividend yield of more than 4.5%, which could offer investors steady income in the coming years.

Certainly, Pfizer is grappling with a myriad of uncertainties, including concerns over its growth prospects post-pandemic. Naturally, it was one of the biggest pharma players during the pandemic, and the steep comps significantly impacted its financials. However, the company is confronting these challenges head-on by investing aggressively in research and development.

These R&D efforts are projected to produce a robust pipeline, potentially generating more than $20 billion in incremental sales from new molecular entities by the conclusion of the current decade. Furthermore, new business developments are expected to contribute another $25 billion in revenue by the same timeline.

Merck (NYSE:MRK) the powerhouse behind treatments such as Keytruda and Gardasil, poses a fruitful opportunity for discerning investors. It’s a stalwart that’s not just recognized for its healthcare solutions but an attractive quarterly dividend yield of more than 2.58%.

Despite the slower sales of Lagevrio, Merck’s coronavirus antiviral pill tugged revenues down 9% to $14.5 billion in the first quarter this year. A look into its R&D pipeline reveals a focus on a broad spectrum of diseases, spotlighting oncology, infectious diseases, cardio-metabolic disorders, and neuroscience. Some noteworthy candidates, such as gefapixant for overactive bladder, filodesin for type 2 diabetes, and others, point to its massive long-term potential.

Merck’s market position remains sturdy, with nearly half its robust pipeline close to regulatory approval. Apart from that, its existing product offerings are generating sales of more than $40 billion, making it a name to watch in the pharma sphere.

AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) is anticipated to make a promising rebound despite the recent sluggishness attributed to decreased demand for its Covid products. The UK-based pharmaceutical giant stands out among the best dividend-paying growth stocks, prepped to entice investors with predicted high single-digit to low double-digit earnings growth this year. The projected growth is linked to flourishing drugs such as its cancer treatment Calquence and the diabetes therapy Farxiga, set to balance dwindling sales of its Covid-related offerings effectively.

The company’s future looks even more radiant when peering further down the timeline. With a low double-digit CAGR projected through 2025, AstraZeneca plans to blow past industry averages and maintain its reputation for robust growth.

An impressive phase three pipeline of 30 drugs slated for 2023 lends credibility to these projections and 10 potential blockbusters in the mix. The company’s hefty pipeline of 178 projects and robust global presence casts a ray of optimism on AstraZeneca’s prospects.

As a reminder, to ask a question, please use the raise a hand function in Zoom or alternatively, you can click the Q&A button then write your questions. With that, Pascal, I will hand the call over to you.

Pascal Soriot: Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome. Please move on to the next slide. Total revenue in the first half of the year increased 4% to $22.3 billion, with 16% growth in our non-core medicines, offsetting a $2.2 billion decline in our COVID-19 medicines revenue. Core earnings per share increased 21% to $4.04. This increase reflects both our robust business performance, as well as a gain following an update to our contractor relationships for before in the US. We continue to benefit from our diverse commercial portfolio and our global footprint. Given our strong execution in the first half, we remain confident in our outlook for the remainder of the year, and we have reiterated our 2023 guidance. Next slide, please.

Taking a closer look at the performance of our non-COVID business across our regions in these areas, growth in the emerging markets continue to be strong. In particular, outside of China, emerging markets outside of China collectively grew by 38% in the first half. This growth underscores our confidence that these markets will become increasingly important to our business. We also saw double-digit growth across the EU and Europe in the period. On the right-hand side, you will see that we delivered a robust double-digit growth across oncology, severe RNI and rare disease. And as expected, we saw declines in B&I. This growth reflects strong medicines performance across these areas. Please advance to the next slide. When we look at performance across our portfolio in the first half, we had eight medicines deliver over $1 billion H1 product sales.

A broad range of these products are driving our growth, as you can see from this slide. For effective life cycle management, we've seen an acceleration in the rate of growth for several medicines, such as Imfinzi and Farxiga with new indications making important contributions to revenues. Ultomiris growth stood at, once again, and is the result of both successful conversion from Soliris as well as growth in patient numbers. We've also seen promising global growth from some of our more recently launched medicines including an HER2, Calquence, Breast03, Troponin and Saphnelo, all of which are helping to change the course of their respective diseases. Next slide, please. Confidence in our long-term outlook is supported by our robust let stage pipeline, which now has well over 120 active projects.

Importantly, we maintain a rigorous approach to R&D development. Setting a high bar for late-stage trial initiations and advancing only the most promising projects. We strive to stay at the front of the innovation curve and we have already progressed 14 new molecular entities into lettuce development. We're making good progress towards initiating 30 new pivotal trials this year, having those nine in the year-to-date with recent additions, including the lithos trial for Breast03 asthma and two next-generation propane trials, which will support the expansion of our PMDI portfolio. As we indicated last quarter, most of the new pivotal trials are expected to dose in the second half of this year. Our pipeline continues to make exciting progress with eight positive pivotal oncology trials already this year.

These are shown on the right-hand side of this slide. In particular, we are encouraged by the positive results from the TROPION-Lung01 trial of Dato-DXd and are excited to unlock the full potential of this promising medicine. On the next slide, Aradhana can take you through our financial highlights in the first half as well as provide some further insights into how we are embracing the power of artificial intelligence across our manufacturing and supply chain. Over to you, Aradhana.

Aradhana Sarin: Thank you, Pascal, and good afternoon, everyone. As usual, I'll start with our reported P&L. Please advance to the next slide. As Pascal mentioned, total revenue increased by 4% to $2.3 billion in the first half. Total revenue, excluding COVID-19 medicines, increased 16%. Alliance revenue of $627 million includes $475 million of an HER2 profit sharing from geographies where Daiichi Sankyo books product sales. Collaboration revenue of $220 million includes $180 million license fee from Serum Institute of India booked in the second quarter relating to our COVD-19 and anti-body license agreement. Please advance to the next slide, which shows our core P&L. The core product sales gross margin in the first half was 82.9%, benefiting from lower production costs in prior quarters, and certain non-recurring items in the first quarter.

As previously communicated, we expect the product sales gross margin in the second half to be negatively impacted, similar to in prior years, by seasonality for Flumis and certain other medicines, the mandatory price reduction for Tagrisso in Japan, as well as the full impact of inflation. We still expect the product sales gross margin on a full year basis to be slightly higher than pre-COVID-19 levels. Looking ahead beyond 2023, we expect product sales gross margin percentage will be negatively impacted by profit sharing arrangements. While we already see this dynamic with Lynparza, we anticipate the impact to increase as we start seeing higher sales from medicines such as HER2 and Tezspire in regions where we book product sales and then pay out a portion of profits to our partners through cost of sales.

Over the long-term, we're focusing on driving productivity improvements to counter the impact on our gross margin from inflation, continued growth in emerging markets and more complex and expensive manufacturing of new modalities we're investing in. Core operating expenses in the half increased by 8%, R&D costs increased by 9%, driven by continued investments in our pipeline. The increase in SG&A costs partly reflects spend behind new launches such as TOPAZ and HIMALAYA, which are driving the strong growth of Imfinzi and DUO, for example, as well as existing brands like Farxiga and Breast03 and geographic expansion of the rare disease medicines portfolio. We previously guided for total core operating expenses to increase by low to mid-single-digit percentage in 2023, and we now expect to finish the year towards the upper end of this range.

Similar to the phasing we observed in 2022, we expect R&D and SG&A spend to be weighted towards the second half. Other operating income of $1.1 billion includes $712 million related to the previously announced updated agreements on the Beyfortus, which was booked in the second quarter. The increase in other operating income is in line with the guidance set out at the start of the year where we said that other operating income would be higher versus last year. The tax rate in the second quarter was lower than full year guidance due to certain tax incentives and mix of profits and lower tax legal entities. For the full year, we continue to expect this core tax rate will be between 8% and 22%. Core EPS of $4.07 in the first half, represents an increase of 21% at constant exchange rates.

Next slide, please. Our net cash inflow from operating activities increased by $400 million to $4.9 billion, and we continue to see improvement in our cash conversion. Net debt increased by $1 billion to $24 billion, driven by the payment of the second interim dividend in March and $2.4 billion in deal payments, which include the second payment to Acerta made in the first quarter. As a reminder, we will pay the third and final payment in 2024. For the full year, we continue to anticipate deal payments related to prior business transactions to be in line with last year, around $2 billion, excluding Acerta. We have paid just under $1 billion in the first half. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio continues to decrease and is now at 1.9 times or 1.7 times, if excluding the non-cash adjustment for the Alexion inventory fair value uplift, which will soon disappear as we have now minimal inventory remaining from the time of the acquisition.

Today, we are reiterating our 2023 total revenue and core EPS guidance. Total revenues are expected to increase by low to mid-single-digit percentage. Excluding COVID-19 total revenue are expected to increase by low double-digit percentage. Growth in the second half will be hampered by patented expiries, including SynCor in the U.S. and Nexium in Japan, where we saw first generics end of last year. We now anticipate revenue in China to increase by a low to mid-single-digit percentage. And as I mentioned earlier, we now anticipate total operating expenses on the our end of the range, with phasing of SG&A costs towards the second half of the year, similar to prior years. In addition, given that we anticipate starting several new Phase 3 trials in the second half of the year, R&D and associated clinical and new product costs will be higher in the second half.

Based on June average FX rates, we now anticipate a low single-digit adverse FX impact on total revenue and a low to mid-single-digit adverse impact on core EPS. Please advance to the next slide. Continuing with the artificial intelligence team, today, I want to highlight global operations and how we are leveraging AI to accelerate drug development manufacturing processes and drive supply chain efficiencies. To share three specific examples here. First, in drug development, with our in-house AI-enabled tool, loop manager, we have reduced in route synthesis lead times from 9 to 12 months to five to six months, and we're striving to further reduce lead times to less than three months. Additionally, with this tool, we have been able to reduce the number of experimental trials cutting lead times and driving efficiencies in case while also providing sustainability benefits through fewer synthetic steps.

Next, with AI-powered visualization of data, our operators are able to improve process performance for synthetic and biologic medicine by identifying critical variables that will affect yields and make real-time optimization adjustments. In the future, advanced continuous process verification will drive further robustness and yield increases. Third example, we've implemented AI-enabled enhancements across our supply chain. For example, Sweden is one of our largest global sites, manufacturing over 12 billion tablets and capsules every year. Here, we use AI-powered digital twins that can leverage multiple data sources simultaneously, such as production orders, dispensing stations and cleaning status to optimize production schedules. This technology has already delivered a 90% improvement in scheduling time, meaning we can now develop a dispensing plan in only four to five [ph] minutes worth used to take eight hours.

Our ambition is to leverage many of these tools and roll them throughout our manufacturing and supply network. This is, of course, a journey, but the work is already underway to use technology to drive efficiencies. While our operations team continues to deliver on seamless supply and new product launch delivery. With that, please advance to the next slide, and I will hand over to Dave to walk through our oncology business performance.

David Fredrickson: Thank you, Aradhana. Next slide, please. We're pleased to report our oncology medicines delivered total revenues in the first half of $8.8 billion, an increase of 22% versus the prior year. We delivered double-digit product sales growth across all regions. Turning to individual medicine performance in the second quarter, Tagrisso Global revenues grew 10%, reflecting strong underlying demand for Dora and Flora across all regions. As expected, effective this June, we realized a mandatory price reduction in Japan. And in China, second quarter revenues reflect the first full quarter of -- renewal pricing following reenlistment this March. Following the ASCO plenary presentation of Adora overall survival data last month, we expect expanded use of Tagrisso in the adjuvant setting as well as potential for new reimbursements in certain geographies.

Lastly, as we consider the future impact from IRA, our current interpretation of CMS final guidance supports the potential exclusion for Tagrisso under orphan drug protections. Lynparza remains the leading PARP inhibitor globally and delivered -- sales growth of 9%. In the US, we saw sequential demand decline across the PARP inhibitor class following competitor label restrictions in second-line ovarian cancer. We continue to work on opportunities for US demand expansion in ovarian and HR-positive breast cancer, but still expect this to be more challenging. Outside of the US, we saw double-digit product sales growth across the EU, established rest of world, and emerging markets. In Q2, Imfinzi total revenues, inclusive of Imjudo, surpassed $1 billion in a quarter for the first time, up 58% and largely driven by new launches of TOPAZ, HIMALAYA, and POSEIDON.

I'll touch on specific Imfinzi growth drivers a bit later, but needless to say, we're excited by what the team has accomplished within a competitive I-O class. Calquence total revenues increased 34% year-on-year, supported by ex-US demand growth, particularly in Europe. And in the US, Calquence continues to maintain leadership in frontline CLL with the majority of new patient starts in this setting. However, we continue to see some new patient share loss in the relapsed/refractory segment. In HER2 total revenues of $322 million in the second quarter increased 176% year-on-year. In the US in HER2 new patient share in the HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer setting remains at a -- and in the hormone receptor positive HER2 low post chemo-metastatic breast cancer share has now grown to above 50%.

Importantly, we're seeing strong continued demand across the globe, particularly in European markets. Following the exciting approval for DESTINY-Breast03 in China last quarter, we received approval for HER2 in HER2 low metastatic breast cancer. Also during the period, we received approval for PROPEL in the US and anticipate a potential regulatory milestone to be paid in the second half of the year. And finally, we were granted priority review in the US for Capitala 291. Next slide, please. We've seen remarkable Imfinzi and Imjudo growth, driven by the recent launches of TOPAZ, HIMALAYA, and POSEIDON. We're excited about the current trajectory of these launches and the broader potential of Imfinzi as supported by the suite of ongoing life cycle management programs.

First, HIMALAYA and unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma has established a clear foothold for Imfinzi in GI cancers. Last month at ESMO World GI, we presented unprecedented four-year overall survival data, the longest follow-up to-date in unresectable HCC. This sustained benefit, coupled with strong safety will continue to support rapid adoption and the establishment of a new standard-of-care. The launch of TOPAZ represents a step change innovation in biliary tract cancer and the strength of this data demonstrates the transformative benefit of IO in this setting. In the US, TOPAZ has become the undisputed standard-of-care within months. and the EU and Japan much are already outpacing the US trajectory. We're making progress with POSEIDON in the US and in Europe with a crowded and competitive setting.

This launch together with our efforts with Pacific and Caspian continue to solidify a strong leadership position within lung cancer. In the first half of this year, we delivered four positive Phase III trials of novel Imfinzi combinations across lung, GI and GYN settings. MATTERHORN and gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer was the first global Phase III and trial of IO plus flat that demonstrates statistically significant pathologic complete response. In endometrial cancer, we are excited to report that DOE showed Imfinzi + Lynparza and Imfinzi alone significantly improved progression-free survival, and Susan will cover these trials in more detail shortly. Over the balance of the year, we look forward to additional Phase III readouts with PACIFIC-2 in lung cancer and EMERALD-1 in GI.

Building on HIMALAYA, EMERALD-1 and EMERALD-2 will enable our leadership in HCC. Finally, we'll continue to advance our next wave of IO with our novel bispecifics, volrustomig and rivagustimig and sabestomig. With that, please advance to the next slide, and I'll hand over to Susan to cover key R&D highlights in the quarter.

2023-07-31T17:25:10+00:00,UPDATE 1-On Semiconductor forecasts robust Q3 revenue on silicon carbide strength,"(Updates share price, adds comments from CEO interview)

By Zaheer Kachwala and Stephen Nellis

July 31 (Reuters) - Chipmaker ON Semiconductor Corp on Monday forecast third-quarter revenue above market estimates on optimism that strong demand from the automotive sector will offset broader weakness in the semiconductor industry.

Shares of the Arizona-based company were up more than 3.4% to $108.68 by midday after gaining 68.5% so far this year.

The rising adoption of electric vehicles has been a boon for chipmakers like Onsemi and NXP Semiconductors. Onsemi said in May it was considering investing over $2 billion to boost the production of silicon carbide chips used to extend the range of EVs.

Onsemi is considering existing sites in Korea, the United States and the Czech Republic for the new factory.

Hassane El-Khoury, the chipmaker's chief executive, told Reuters that the company is open to building brand new factories if demand continues to rise. But in the meantime, using an existing site will help bring the silicon carbide business's profit margins in line with the broader company's margins, even after accounting for spending money to expand production.

""At this at this point (an existing site) is the way to go, and we pay for it with operating cash flow,"" El-Khoury told Reuters.

Automotive chipmaker NXP last week forecast a strong third-quarter revenue and profit, exuding confidence over a steady automotive demand.

Onsemi, which makes sensors and supplies chips to companies like Volkswagen, expects revenue between $2.10 billion to $2.20 billion in the third quarter. Analysts on average expect revenue of $2.07 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Its forecast for adjusted earnings of $1.27 to $1.41 per share, was also above estimates of $1.21 per share.

For the second quarter ended June 30, the company's revenue rose to $2.09 billion, ahead of analysts' expectations of $2.02 billion. The revenue was boosted by Onsemi's power solutions group, which provides power management chips, making up about 53% of total quarterly revenue.

On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.33 per share in the reported quarter, compared with estimates of $1.21 per share, according to Refinitiv.

The stock markets have been through the wringer in the recent past especially since March 2022 as the United States Federal Reserve began its tightening process. Despite that, major stock indices in the United States have already recuperated some of their losses in the recent past. The S&P 500 Index is up 3.07% in July and nearly 20% since the beginning of the year. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the NASDAQ-100 indices are up 7.1% and 45.1% year-to-date, respectively.

Several factors, including major breakthroughs in the Artificial Intelligence arena, a pause in interest rate hikes, better than expected inflation results, and resilient economic growth. The latest economic data shows that the United States economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.4% in Q2 2023, nearly a full percentage point more than consensus estimates.

After a streak of 10 consecutive interest rate hikes over the period of 14 months by the United States Federal Reserve, the Fed kept the interest rate unchanged in its June meeting. On July 26, the Fed announced a further 25 bps interest rate hike which brings the funds rate to a target range of 5.25%-5.5%. This marks the benchmark rate at its highest level since 2001.

The comments of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at a press conference generated mixed results for the equities markets. Even though policymakers indicated the possibility of two rate hikes by the end of the year, in their June meeting, Powell’s comments have raised hopes for just the one interest rate hike this year. The Fed Chairman affirmed that the central bank intends to make data-driven decisions concerning any further rate hikes on a “meeting-by-meeting” basis.

Jerome Powell said in his press conference on July 26:

“I would say it’s certainly possible that we will raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warranted. And I would also say it’s possible that we would choose to hold steady and we’re going to be making careful assessments, as I said, meeting by meeting.”

The S&P 500 index is highly concentrated this year, with the highest weightage of the five largest holdings since 1990.

2023-07-24T15:40:11+00:00,ROST or COST: Which Is the Better Value Stock Right Now?,"Investors interested in Retail - Discount Stores stocks are likely familiar with Ross Stores (ROST) and Costco (COST). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.

There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.

Ross Stores has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Costco has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that ROST has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.

Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.

The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.

ROST currently has a forward P/E ratio of 22.75, while COST has a forward P/E of 38.74. We also note that ROST has a PEG ratio of 2.17. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. COST currently has a PEG ratio of 4.66.

Another notable valuation metric for ROST is its P/B ratio of 8.89. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, COST has a P/B of 10.49.

These metrics, and several others, help ROST earn a Value grade of B, while COST has been given a Value grade of C.

ROST sticks out from COST in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that ROST is the better option right now.

While you may have an investing style you rely on, finding great stocks is made easier with the Zacks Style Scores. These are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on value, growth, and/or momentum characteristics.

Why Investors Should Pay Attention to This Value Stock

Different than growth or momentum investors, value-focused investors are all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under what their true value is before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.

Ross Stores (ROST)

Based in Dublin, CA, Ross Stores Inc. operates as an off-price retailer of apparel and home accessories, primarily in the United States. The company operates its stores under the Ross Dress for Less (Ross) and dd’s DISCOUNTS names. The company’s stores are located mostly in community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas.

ROST is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, with a Value Style Score of B and VGM Score of A.

Additionally, ROST has a PEG Ratio of 2.2 and a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 20.3X. Value investors should also note ROST's Price/Sales ratio of 2X.

ROST also holds an average earnings surprise of 11.5%.

2023-07-20T15:12:00+00:00,4 Retail Discount Stocks Thriving Amid Industry Challenges,"Consumer spending activity, which is one of the pivotal factors driving the economy, has somewhat slowed down. Underlying inflationary pressure, a slowing labor market, a higher interest rate environment and reductions in pandemic savings have collectively dampened demand. Of late, players in the Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry have been encountering these headwinds.

That said, industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, adding more compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Inventory management, supply-chain enhancement, cost-structure realignment and investments to accelerate digitization have been working in favor of companies like Costco Wholesale Corporation COST, The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX, Target Corporation TGT and Ross Stores, Inc. ROST.

About the Industry

The Retail – Discount Stores industry comprises companies that offer apparel, accessories, footwear, beauty products, personal and baby care products, cleaning products, pet supplies, and food and beverage products at lower prices than traditional retail outlets. The industry participants also provide home textiles, home furnishings, housewares, art and craft supplies, toys and seasonal decor products. These companies sell their products through stores, digital channels, or both. Some industry players operate membership shopping warehouse clubs, offering branded and private-label products in a range of merchandise categories. Most discount stores are gradually emerging as one-stop shopping destinations. The profitability of players depends on a prudent pricing model, a well-organized supply chain and an effective merchandising strategy.

4 Key Industry Trends to Watch

Soft Demand May Hit Revenues: The industry’s prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. Consumer spending, a key catalyst for the economy, has recently shown signs of slowing down. Several factors have come into play, including underlying inflationary pressure, a slowing labor market, a higher interest rate environment and reductions in pandemic savings. We note that U.S. retail sales experienced a slight uptick in June 2023, falling short of analysts’ expectations. Retail sales showed 0.2% growth, marking a deceleration from the 0.5% growth recorded in May. Additionally, there are indications that the Federal Reserve is likely to resume raising interest rates this month, following a period of unchanged rates in June.

Pressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail-discount space highly competitive. This has compelled many players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks and adopting effective pricing policies.

Consumers Seek Better Bargains: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers in low-to-middle-income groups who have been seeking both value and convenience, particularly in the face of rising prices. Industry participants have been focusing on creating innovative and compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities to attract price-sensitive consumers.

Digitization Is the Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives, such as building omnichannel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at the store, are worth mentioning. Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.

Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak Prospects

The Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #235, which places it in the bottom 6% of more than 250 Zacks industries.

The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates drab near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of January 2023, the industry’s earnings estimate has declined 10.5%.

Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.

The Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry has underperformed the broader Retail – Wholesale sector and the Zacks S&P 500 composite over the past year.

Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 29.98X and as low as 18.04X, with the median being at 23.59X, as the chart below shows.

2023-07-31T19:52:35+00:00,7 Stocks to Buy Before They Surpass 2021 Highs,"The stock market has rebounded in 2023 following a year marked by rate hikes that pulled everything much lower. Leading indexes fell dramatically with the S&P 500 shedding 18.25% of its value. Hikes pounded the tech-heavy Nasdaq which fell by more than 30% during the same period. The emergence of AI, along with slowing rate hikes, has catalyzed a rebound in the markets in 2023. However, major indexes haven’t reached their 2021 highs. With inflation falling and rate hikes nearly over there’s reason to believe that the markets- and stocks could surge past their high marks in 2021. Let’s dive into a few of the top stocks to watch before new peaks.

Stocks to Watch Before New Peaks: AMD (AMD) man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% Upside

Source: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.com

I’ve been saying the same thing about AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) stock for the past few weeks. If you’ve read my articles during that period, this will be a bit repetitive. That said, it remains true and serves as a logical basis for prices to move upward: AMD is not that far behind its main rival, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).

The reason to believe that this is true lies in research recently released by MosaicML, a machine learning firm that was recently acquired by Databricks. MosaicML undertook extensive testing of the second-most powerful chips from AMD and Nvidia in relation to their AI prowess.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The result was particularly inspiring for AMD champions: Its chips are nearly as fast as those from Nvidia. Further, AMD’s relative strengths in software development are particularly relevant to AI. The software has been identified as an area from which rapid AI improvements will emerge. It all points to the idea that AMD could run much higher. AMD hit $154 in 2021 and currently stands at $111.

Stocks to Watch Before New Peaks: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""

Source: PX Media / Shutterstock

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock traded roughly $5 higher at its 2021 peak from its current price. You may be tempted to believe that those higher prices are logical given that it was one of the major firms to produce a Covid-19 vaccine. The logic is that revenues spiked on its approval and that Johnson & Johnson lacks a similar catalyst at the moment.

Story continues

While it’s true that there is no similar catalyst for the firm at the moment, there’s a simple reason to believe in JNJ shares. Johnson & Johnson’s revenues reached $94.94 billion in 2021. In 2023, they’re expected to eclipse $100 billion. Is that astronomical growth by any stretch of the imagination? No, not all. However, it does prove that JNJ is bigger than it was even when it had a Covid-19 vaccine. The other vaccine winners, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) will have far smaller revenue bases in 2023 than each did in 2021, respectively.

JNJ is the most stable of the bunch. Its revenues will be greater in 2023 than in 2021. Thus, its price-to-sales ratio is more attractive at the moment. Add in JNJ’s dividend and the choice gets even easier.

Stocks to Watch Before New Peaks: Coca-Cola (KO) Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker cryptos

Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) shares traded for $60 at their peak in 2021. KO stock currently trades for $62.50 so it has actually surpassed its 2021 highs. Nevertheless, it remains worth considering at this point.

The firm released second-quarter earnings on July 26 which were very strong. Those earnings showed that sales remain very strong, growing at 6% with organic revenue growing at 11%.

That allowed management to raise its full-year forecast for organic revenue growth to between 8-9% from a previous 7-8% in 2023. The results come as Coca-Cola has raised prices even as consumers are already dealing with inflation that erodes their purchasing power. It indicates that demand remains very strong overall.

It’s difficult to find much fault in Coca-Cola’s execution and results even if you feel they could have given consumers a break in pricing. Shareholders are certainly happy. EPS increased by 34%, reaching $0.59. KO stock’s dividend is a bonus and yields nearly 3% currently.

Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) currently makes a lot of sense as a stock investment. The search giant just released second-quarter earnings that were much better than expected and should galvanize a period in which share prices rise.

Revenues for the quarter reached $74.6 billion, ahead of the $72.9 billion Wall Street had been expecting. That earnings beat will be consequential for investors over the coming weeks and months. The beat led to strong income growth of 14.79%(1) which was another bright spot for the firm.

Revenue growth reached 7% on a year-over-year basis down from 13% a year earlier. Slowing growth rates should matter but I’d argue they’re less of a concern due to the overall trajectory. Alphabet is expecting more than $300 billion in sales this year which is a turnaround from the $283 billion in 2022. Search, advertising, Cloud, and other bets are all growing and as rate hikes stop GOOG stock is in a strong position overall relative to its 2021 peak prices.

Meta Platforms (META)  hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks

Investors should consider riding the upward momentum in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock. The fundamental case underpinning that idea is very solid. That’s where we’ll start.

Here’s what I particularly like about META shares currently: Even though the firm’s revenues grew in both the last 3 months and the last 6 months, net income did not. It decreased on a year-over-year basis during the most recent 6 months. However, it increased on a year-over-year basis during the latest 3-month period on a year-over-year basis. That suggests that Meta Platforms is doing much better now and that a real turnaround is in effect.

That’s true despite the fact that Reality Labs’ losses are getting bigger. Ad revenues and its Facebook and Instagram apps have rebounded. That’s very important to the overall narrative for Meta. The economy looks to have dodged the worst outcomes of rate hikes at this point. That should inspire businesses to spend more on ad revenue and continue to bolster META shares in the process.

Albemarle (ALB)  tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocks

Source: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.com

Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) has emerged as one of the more important EV stocks over the past few years. Its position is secured in the sector. Lithium demand is expected to grow. Those factors are powerful and have led Albemarle to make bold projections that should have investor interest piqued.

Before I get into that, let me quickly note how rapidly Albemarle is growing. In Q1, revenues grew by 129% reaching $2.6 billion while net income rose by 389%. Even though prices were not stable those results proved that lithium demand is massive on EV sales that aren’t weakening.

Let’s get back to those projections. Albemarle increased its 2030 lithium demand forecast by 15% over its previous expectations early this year. The company anticipates increasing demand through 2030 paired with a supply shortfall. The economic takeaway is clear: Prices are going to rise over the long term. Current prices make for a good entry point.

Microsoft (MSFT)  Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks

Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares recently tested new all-time highs of $350 before quickly falling to $330. I think the market has got it wrong: MSFT stock is worth $350 per share. The decline is an opportunity.

The reason to believe so is simple: Microsoft traded at $330 in 2021, a year in which the company reported $168 in sales. It could eclipse $240 billion in sales this year. Thus, its price-to-sales ratio clearly favors the notion that share prices could burst above $350 moving forward.

Why shouldn’t investors believe that idea? After all, Microsoft has made massive strides in AI. It is finding new revenue streams therein. Office 365 AI integrations are the latest news on that front. Time will tell how that goes. In any case, Microsoft is now a better firm than it was back in 2021 when it traded at a similar price. It’s a very simple, logical argument, and simple, logical arguments are often very powerful.

2023-07-31T16:50:00+00:00,Moderna (MRNA) to Report Q2 Earnings: Will It Beat Estimates?,"We expect Moderna MRNA to beat expectations when it releases second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 3, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company reported an earnings surprise of 110.73%.

Factors to Note

During the second quarter, sales of COVID-19 vaccines are likely to have declined significantly due to lower demand. The Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate for second-quarter product sales is pegged at $233 million and $246 million, respectively.

Due to the substantial fall in COVID-19 vaccine sales compared with previous quarters’ levels, we expect Moderna to post its first quarterly loss in over two years since the FDA’s first authorization to its COVID vaccine in December 2020.

Earlier this month, Moderna initiated regulatory submissions for its mRNA-based RSV vaccine, mRNA-1345, for use in older adults (aged 60 years and above) in several markets, including the United States, Europe and Australia. We expect mRNA-1345 to be the company’s next major commercial launch following its blockbuster COVID-19 vaccines. Investors could expect the company to discuss the commercial rollout plan for mRNA-1345 during the second-quarter earnings conference call.

Investors would also be inclined about Moderna’s progress with its pipeline. The company is developing more than 30 mRNA-based investigational candidates in different stages of clinical studies, targeting different indications, including cancer. Moderna is evaluating three candidates in late-stage studies — mRNA-1647 (cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine), mRNA-1010 (influenza vaccine) and mRNA-4157/V940 [personalized cancer vaccine (PCV)].

Last month, Moderna and Merck MRK reported new data from the phase IIb evaluating mRNA-4157, in melanoma indication. Data from the study showed that mRNA-4157 combined with Merck’s Keytruda reduced the risk of distant metastasis or death by 65% compared with participants who were treated with Merck's Keytruda alone. The study previously achieved its primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival. Moderna/Merck initiated the phase III study on mRNA-4157 in melanoma patients based on these positive results.

Moderna also records collaboration revenue from partners who use its mRNA technology to develop therapies targeting different indications. The Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate for second-quarter collaboration revenues are pegged at $13.3 million and $10.0 million, respectively.

Investors would also like to seek updates from management on the company’s recently entered deal with the Chinese government to research, develop and manufacture mRNA medicines exclusively for sale in China. Multiple reports suggest that Moderna could invest up to a billion dollars in the deal.

Earnings Surprise History

The company’s surprise history has been mixed, with earnings beating estimates in two of the trailing four quarters while missing on the other two occasions. The average surprise is 21.97%.

2023-07-26T14:02:12+00:00,Seattle Genetics (SGEN) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,"Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Seattle Genetics (SGEN) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.

The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.

While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.

Zacks Consensus Estimate

This biotechnology company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -9.6%.

Revenues are expected to be $557 million, up 12% from the year-ago quarter.

Estimate Revisions Trend

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.

Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.

Earnings Whisper

Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.

A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.

Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).

How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Seattle Genetics?

For Seattle Genetics, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +4.76%.

On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.

So, this combination indicates that Seattle Genetics will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?

Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.

For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Seattle Genetics would post a loss of $0.82 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.93, delivering a surprise of -13.41%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.

Bottom Line

An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.

That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Seattle Genetics appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

An Industry Player's Expected Results

Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT), another stock in the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $2.03 for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +23.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $264.45 million, up 13.3% from the year-ago quarter.

The consensus EPS estimate for Sarepta Therapeutics has been revised 3.4% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 8.01%.

This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Sarepta Therapeutics will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.

2023-07-14T01:24:24+00:00,3 Pharma Stocks That AI is Loving in July,"When it comes to investing in pharmaceutical stocks, an intriguing area for future growth is gene editing. This is an exciting field that may provide a solution to some of our most vexing diseases, such as cancer and diabetes.

And in 2023, many companies are closer than ever to a solution. So, although I know that’s not how it works, it was interesting that when ChatGPT gave me a list of pharmaceutical stocks, it included several which have partnerships with gene editing companies.

It’s important to note that pure-play gene editing companies, such as CRISPR Technologies (NASDAQ:CRSP), carry significant risk. But being cautious doesn’t have to mean staying on the sidelines. It can simply be a matter of knowing what you own.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The companies that are in partnerships with these pure-play gene editing companies make it more likely that the promise of gene editing will result in commercially approved and available products. They’re also examples of the high potential pharma stocks you can consider for long-term growth.

For better or worse, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is synonymous with its Covid-19 vaccine. Many investors plowed into PFE stock in 2020. But many of those investors likely sold their positions as sales of the company’s Covid-19 vaccine Comirnaty and its antiviral Paxlovid are normalizing.

That has sent the stock down nearly 38% from its all-time high of $59.48 on December 17, 2021. The question that investors should consider is what is the outlook for PFE stock when considering investing in pharma stocks?

The answer may be 19. That’s the number of drug launches and label expansions the company has planned in the next year. The company also projects these drugs to generate $20 billion in sales by 2030. That would be about 20% of the total revenue the company generated in 2022.

Not all of these drugs will hit, of course. But Pfizer also recently acquired Seagen (NASDAQ:SGEN) for $43 billion. This will allow the company to expand its portfolio of oncology drugs. And it provides more opportunity for the company to deliver shareholder value.

The company is also expanding into other areas such as gene editing. In 2022, Pfizer announced a $1.3 billion partnership with Beam Therapeutics (NASDAQ:BEAM). The companies will use Beam’s “base editing” technology to make precise corrections to typographical errors in gene sequences.

And the best news of all is that Pfizer stock is objectively undervalued. It currently trades at just 7x earnings and has a dividend with a 4.5% yield.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) Various medical equipment is on top of a page with information about cystic fibrosis.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) is another company that is using gene editing to go beyond its core capabilities. The company is currently best known for being the leader in cystic fibrosis treatments.

The company recently received an expanded use authorization (EUA) that will allow its flagship drug, Trikafta, to be used on children ages 2 through 5 that meet certain conditions.

That alone will ensure that Vertex will continue to deliver solid revenue and earnings. But the company may deliver another $1 billion in revenue by 2028 due to Vertex’s partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics. Under terms of the licensing deal, Vertex is helping advance CRISPR’s Exa-Cel platform which is in clinical trials for transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia and severe sickle cell disease.

And that deal is in addition to Vertex’s own pipeline,which includes potential new treatments for diabetes and pain management.

Regeneron (REGN) The Regeneron (REGN) website is displayed on a smartphone screen over a blue background.

A third company to consider for investing in pharma stocks is Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN). The company became a household name in 2020 after the U.S. government awarded Regeneron with $450 million to manufacture a therapeutic to lessen the severity of Covid-19 symptoms. It didn’t hurt that it’s most famous test case was the occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue at that time: Donald Trump.

Unlike other companies that were winners during the pandemic, REGN stock only began to retreat in April 2023. And even that is an inauspicious drop of about 3.9%. However, there may still be an opportunity for investors to profit from taking a position in Regeneron.

One reason for that comes from the company’s long-standing gene editing partnership with Intellia Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NTLA). While this partnership may take a long time to play out, it’s another example of a company that is developing multiple revenue streams which makes it one of the high potential pharma stocks for this month and beyond.

2023-07-31T22:52:59+00:00,Buy Alert: 3 Robotics Stocks Nearing Super Attractive Entry Points,"Before artificial intelligence (AI) became a household word, there was robotics. And the emergence of AI is only drawing more attention to high-potential robotics investments.

AI stocks have been red hot in 2023, and AI will continue to be one of the hottest sectors for investors for the rest of the decade. However, there is some concern that some air is coming out of the AI bubble. And with lingering concerns about a recession, valuation worries are likely to grow.

That could lead investors to consider some AI-adjacent sectors to invest in. One of those would be robotics. Before AI caught the attention of investors, many companies were developing tools that were increasing business productivity by automating many tasks.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

A key growth area in this sector is robotic process automation (RPA) software. According to Polaris Market Research, the global RPA market will grow to $66.08 billion by 2032. That will be a 37.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from the $2.7 billion market it was in 2022.

That’s an opportunity long-term investors can capitalize on. Here are three high-potential robotics investments to consider.

Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) Cognizant Technology Solutions logo on a corporate building

Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com

Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH) is not a pure-play robotics company. But the technology and consulting firm makes this list of high-potential robotics investments because of its Cognizant Automation Center Robots as a Service (RaaS) program.

According to Cognizant, RaaS allows customers to replace any human process that does not require intuition.

On the plus side, Cognizant is a profitable company that continues to have a strong revenue base. However, in 2023, revenue has been down slightly on a year-over-year (YOY) basis. And the company says revenue is expected to decline by 1.2% for the full year.

On the other hand, earnings are expected to grow, and free cash flow is increasing. Yet, CTSH stock is down about 7% from its 52-week high. Add in a forward price-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 15x, and you get a picture of a company that is undervalued relative to its prospects.

UiPath (PATH) An image of UiPath's logo; white text over an orange background

UiPath (NYSE:PATH) has been one of the top-performing stocks of 2023. The company now has a market cap of over $10 billion and is recognized as a leading software company specializing in RPA technology.

The company’s platform is being sought after as businesses look to use robotics and AI to work more efficiently. Specifically, the company specializes in software bots that operate as virtual assistants.

That shows up in the company’s revenue figures which continue to grow on both a sequential and year-over-year (YOY) basis. Significantly, revenue growth in the quarter ending April 30 was 18%. This reversed a trend of declining revenue growth. The company also recently reported a robust dollar-based net retention rate of 122%.

That said, UiPath is not yet profitable, and although it’s supposed to get closer to turning a profit in 2023, it is not expected to achieve that goal for a couple of years.

PTC Inc. (PTC) industrial factory chief engineer wearing AR headset

One of the best ways to look for high-potential robotics investments is through the companies that are the backbone of robotics. That’s the bullish premise for PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC).

In recommending PTC as one of his “millionaire-maker” robotic stocks, my InvestorPlace colleague Josh Enomoto described the company as offering “the software that undergirds robotics.” That’s an apt description for the company, but why is it an opportunity at this time?

PTC is growing revenue at a single-digit rate. But it’s the company’s potential earnings growth that got my attention. That full-year growth is expected to be around 28%. But analysts only project stock price growth of about 10%. That’s a favorable discrepancy that investors can take advantage of.

A forward P/E ratio of around 47x is a little concerning. But if the company can hit those profit targets, it can justify that valuation. And it’s important to note that institutional investors hold about 91% of PTC stock and have been increasing their buying over the last couple of quarters.

The company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues are expected to be between $4.83 billion and $4.88 billion, indicating a decline of 1% to flat on a constant-currency (cc) basis from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $4.81 billion, suggesting a decline of 1.87% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.

The consensus mark for second-quarter earnings has remained unchanged at 97 cents per share in the past 30 days, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 14.91%.

Cognizant beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in two of the trailing four quarters and meeting in the remaining two, the average surprise being 2.58%.

Let’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.

Factors to Note

Cognizant’s second-quarter 2023 performance is likely to have benefited from significant growth in its digital business operations. This reflects on momentum in AI, health sciences, automation, IoT, quantum computing and as-a-service solutions.

The company has been benefiting from solid partnerships as companies worldwide are accelerating digital transformation. During the to-be-reported quarter, it partnered with companies like Orkla and ServiceNow to optimize operations across sectors, bolster AI-driven automation and expedite innovation.

The high demand across its Healthcare segment has been noteworthy. Partnerships with Accuray and Microsoft are expected to have expanded its footprint in the healthcare market. Our model estimate for second-quarter 2023 Healthcare revenues is pegged at $1.41 billion, indicating a 0.3% year-over-year growth.

Cognizant banks on a long-standing client relationship, robust product pipeline and a global delivery network. In the second quarter, it initiated the NextGen program to simplify the operating model, optimize corporate functions and realign the workforce. These factors are likely to have driven its second-quarter top line.

A declining attrition rate on a sequential basis is expected to have contributed to Cognizant’s performance. Our model estimate for second-quarter 2023 attrition rate is pegged at 22.2% compared with 23% in the previous quarter and 31% in the year-ago quarter.

However, challenging macroeconomic conditions, raging inflation and stiff competition are expected to have hurt top-line growth.

Softer discretionary spending and decision delays by existing and potential clients are expected to have hurt Financial Services and Communications, Media & Technology (CMT) solutions. Our model estimate for second-quarter 2023 Financial Services and CMT revenues is pegged at $1.48 billion and $797 million, indicating a 4.1% and 2.4% year-over-year decline, respectively.

What Our Model Says

Per the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.

2023-07-31T12:44:12+00:00,Shareholders in Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH) are in the red if they invested five years ago,"While it may not be enough for some shareholders, we think it is good to see the Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ:CTSH) share price up 11% in a single quarter. But over the last half decade, the stock has not performed well. After all, the share price is down 16% in that time, significantly under-performing the market.

So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.

Check out our latest analysis for Cognizant Technology Solutions

While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.

During the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, Cognizant Technology Solutions actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 13% per year. So it doesn't seem like EPS is a great guide to understanding how the market is valuing the stock. Or possibly, the market was previously very optimistic, so the stock has disappointed, despite improving EPS.

It's strange to see such muted share price performance despite sustained growth. Perhaps a clue lies in other metrics.

The modest 1.8% dividend yield is unlikely to be guiding the market view of the stock. In contrast to the share price, revenue has actually increased by 4.8% a year in the five year period. A more detailed examination of the revenue and earnings may or may not explain why the share price languishes; there could be an opportunity.

What About Dividends?

As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Cognizant Technology Solutions' TSR for the last 5 years was -10%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!

A Different Perspective

While the broader market gained around 12% in the last year, Cognizant Technology Solutions shareholders lost 1.0% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. However, the loss over the last year isn't as bad as the 2% per annum loss investors have suffered over the last half decade. We would want clear information suggesting the company will grow, before taking the view that the share price will stabilize. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks, for example - Cognizant Technology Solutions has  1 warning sign  we think you should be aware of.

2023-07-06T17:13:38+00:00,10 Best Natural Gas Stocks to Buy Now,"In this article, we discuss the 10 best natural gas stocks to buy now. To skip the detailed analysis of the natural gas industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Natural Gas Stocks to Buy Now.

Natural gas is one of the most used energy sources in the world. In the US alone, it accounted for 32% of the energy consumption in 2021, and in the electricity sector, it accounted for 36% of the U.S. primary energy production.

In 2022, fuel prices including natural gas peaked due to the Russia-Ukraine war which led to sanctions on Russia, resulting in pressure on European and global gas markets. However, due to favorable weather conditions and actions taken by the governments, the pressure on the market eased a little since the beginning of 2023. In Europe, natural gas consumption fell by almost 55 billion cubic meters year-over-year during the 2022/2023 heating season, marking the steepest decline in consumption for any recorded winter season. Furthermore, to avoid further pressures due to the cut-off from Russian exports, the European Union has also unveiled a 210 billion euro plan to completely be rid of Russian fossil fuel dependence by 2027. Compared to 2022, the Russian pipeline gas consumption is expected to drop around 45% in 2023. Nevertheless, In Asia and the Middle East, the natural gas demand is expected to increase by 3% and 2%, respectively, The higher demand from these regions will offset most of the drop in demand from Europe and the US in 2023 which is expected to decline by 5% and 2%, respectively.

In the first quarter of 2023, the natural gas average price at Henry Hub was $2.55 per Metric Million British Thermal Units (MMBtu), which showed an almost 40% YoY decline and a 57% sequential decline. The natural gas price was $4.55 per MMBtu in Q1 2022 and $5.92 per MMBtu in the fourth quarter of 2022. Between mid-December and the first quarter of 2023, natural gas prices dropped by around 70% in Northeast Asian, North American, and European markets.

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) released its short-term energy outlook on June 6 which reveals that the US natural gas production set a monthly record in April with 104 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) production. In the previous month, it was 102 billion cubic feet per day. The EIA expects natural gas production to average around 103 Bcfd in the second half of 2023. According to the EIA’s outlook, natural gas prices are expected to remain conservative in the second half of the year too with an estimated $2.60 per MMBtu average price in the third quarter of 2023. One of the main reasons for these low prices is overstocked inventory. In May, natural gas storage inventories were 15% above the 5-year average.

Despite having a rough time, natural gas prices can still increase over time as it has been a key source of fuel in reducing global carbon emissions. On top of that, if a dry or hotter-than-usual summer comes along and gets followed by a cold winter, the commodity can experience high price volatility. On June 26, natural gas futures to their peak in two months and have since dropped by 6.8% on June 30.

Even though natural gas prices are under pressure due to several factors, the commodity is still expected to play a huge role in the energy industry until renewable energy completely takes over fossil fuels. Due to low prices, natural gas stocks are also experiencing a decline in their stock prices. To take advantage of the situation, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) are some of the best stocks to look out for. 10 Best Natural Gas Stocks to Buy Now

2023-06-14T13:00:00+00:00,CVS Health Enters Agreement With Constellation to Purchase Renewable Energy,"CVS Health’s long-term commitment supports development of 18 megawatts of new solar energy; helps company reduce carbon footprint associated with its energy use by nearly 17,000 metric tons each year

WOONSOCKET, R.I., June 14, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CVS Health® (NYSE: CVS) today announced an 18 megawatt agreement with Constellation (NASDAQ: CEG) to purchase zero-emission, renewable energy equivalent to the annual electricity use of its 147 CVS Health locations throughout Michigan.

Through a 12-year agreement beginning in April 2025, CVS Health will purchase energy and renewable energy certificates (RECs) from Swift Current Energy’s Double Black Diamond Solar Project in Illinois. This is made possible by a long-term agreement between Constellation and Swift Current Energy under which Constellation will purchase a portion of the energy and RECs generated by Double Black Diamond. Construction of the project began in earnest in March 2023.

In total, CVS Health will procure approximately 35,000 megawatt hours of energy per year from Double Black Diamond, which is expected to help the company reduce its carbon footprint by nearly 17,000 metric tons calculated on an annual basis. This is the equivalent emissions of nearly 3,800 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles driven for one year, according to U.S. EPA greenhouse gas equivalencies.

""We continue to see the significant impact the environment has on our health and well-being,"" said Sheryl Burke, SVP of Corporate Social Responsibility and Chief Sustainability Officer for CVS Health. ""That’s why we’re focused on investing in clean, renewable energy and advancing all our sustainability commitments to improve the health of our planet.""

CVS Health will use the Constellation Offsite Renewables (CORe) product to facilitate its renewable energy transaction. CORe connects customers to the economic and sustainability benefits of large-scale, offsite renewable energy projects and is among Constellation’s suite of retail power products that help customers achieve their carbon reduction goals. Customers also have opportunities to utilize our regionally produced hourly carbon-free energy matching solution, which matches power when they need it most.

""By entering into this enduring relationship, CVS Health is embracing sustainable energy sources, while supporting a newly constructed renewable resource,"" stated Jim McHugh, Chief Commercial Officer at Constellation. ""We take great pride in supporting CVS Health on its path towards sustainability and providing them with a carbon-free energy solution that propels their efforts in reducing emissions.""

Investing in renewable energy is part of CVS Health’s commitment to reducing its environmental impact. Recognized as a corporate leader in climate action, the company was one of the first in the world to have its net-zero targets validated by the Science-Based Target Initiative. CVS Health continues to reduce resource consumption across its operations through lighting and transportation upgrades, optimizing digital solutions to reduce paper, alternatives to single-use bags and offering products that are good for customers and the environment.

For more information about CVS Health’s ongoing efforts to build a healthier, more equitable and sustainable future, view the company’s ESG Report.

Eric Lammers, co-founder and CEO, Swift Current Energy, said, ""We are delighted to add CVS Health as the latest customer that will benefit from the emissions-free energy produced by our Double Black Diamond solar project. Double Black Diamond is one of the largest solar projects under construction in the US and is supporting construction jobs, as well as U.S. manufacturing jobs associated with the steel foundations, the tracker systems, and the solar modules. We look forward to bringing the project online next year.""

With an estimated total capacity of 593 MWac, Swift Current Energy’s Double Black Diamond solar project will produce electricity sufficient to power the equivalent of more than 100,000 homes from its location in Sangamon and Morgan counties, Illinois.

2023-06-09T13:23:07+00:00,10 Nuclear Energy Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On,"In this article, we will discuss the 10 nuclear energy stocks that billionaires are loading up on. To skip the details about the nuclear energy industry and upcoming technologies, you can skip to the 5 Nuclear Energy Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.

Nuclear energy accounts for 10% of the global electricity generation. Nuclear energy is a much cleaner source of energy and it has helped avoid over 60 gigatons or 20% of the global carbon emissions in the last 50 years. Despite being relatively environmentally friendly, energy production through nuclear fission is costly. Recently, scientists have made a breakthrough in nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion is the process of joining lighter atoms to form a heavier one. The process creates more energy than a nuclear fission reaction and costs significantly less.

Fusion Industry Association believes that the first fusion power plant will be operational by 2030. On the other hand, a notable nuclear fusion startup, Helion Energy, claims that it will commercialize the first nuclear power plant by 2028. On May 10, the company announced its power purchase agreement with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) for the world’s first commercial fusion generator, which is expected to provide at least 50 megawatts of power.

China has also started to take an interest in nuclear fusion start-ups. The Chinese auto manufacturer, NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) has invested in a nuclear fusion start-up, Neo Fusion, for research and development of nuclear fusion for commercial uses. In 2022, the nuclear fusion start-ups collected more than $2.8 billion in new private investment, bringing the total to $4.7 billion. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) were also some of the names that invested in the research and development of this new technology. Both were part of a $250 million funding raise for TAE Technologies in July 2022.

On May 31, the Department of Energy also announced $46 million in funding to eight fusion development companies. The US Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm said:

“We have generated energy by drawing power from the sun above us. Fusion offers the potential to create the power of the sun right here on Earth [...] The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to partnering with innovative researchers and companies across the country to take fusion energy past the lab and toward the grid.”

Two big names in oil and gas industry, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) and Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR), have backed up Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Zap Energy, respectively. Shell Ventures’ venture principal, Liliia Chechel, said that these investments are quite high-risk but also have the potential to bring a high-reward long term.

Nuclear Fission Energy Industry

Currently, nuclear fission energy is used all over the world. According to the Energy Information Administration, it accounted for 18.9% of the total electricity generation in the United States in 2021. The United States is the top nuclear energy producer in the world and the industry contributes $60 billion to the US GDP annually.

S&P Global reports that around 355 gigawatts will be added to the global nuclear capacity between 2022 and 2025, mostly in mainland China. However, the increase in nuclear capacity will be significantly offset by the retirements in North America and Europe. Between the forecasted period, the global nuclear capacity is expected to increase from 415 gigawatts to 555 gigawatts. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) predicts that by 2050, the nuclear generating capacity will increase to 873 gigawatts net electrical. By the end of the forecasted period, the IAEA believes that nuclear energy will account for 14% of global electricity generation.

In the first quarter of 2023, some billionaires were quite bullish on nuclear energy stocks.

Billionaire Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group increased its stake in Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) by 63986% and became the top hedge fund holder in the company while Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management initiated a position in Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) and was the second biggest stakeholder in the company. Ken Griffin’s and Steve Cohen’s firms have also been the most common names on our list as the former has made additional purchases or bought into six of these companies on the list while Steve Cohen’s firm has done the same in five of these companies.

Some of the most prominent nuclear energy companies that billionaires are loading up on are NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG), and Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ). 10 Nuclear Energy Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On

Our Methodology

For this article, we used Insider Monkey’s database of billionaire hedge fund managers and chose 10 nuclear energy companies they were buying into. These companies are directly involved in the nuclear energy industry and have ongoing operations, including operating nuclear reactors and mining uranium. We excluded the companies that still have nuclear projects under development. We listed the companies in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment. The hedge fund data has been taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds.

The mentioned companies in this article are ones that have ongoing nuclear operations. It does not include the ones that only have investments in nuclear fusion start-ups or any other kind of nuclear future. Hence, we did not mention companies like Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) that billionaire-owned hedge funds are going crazy over.

Great Place to Work® Badge Verisk Once Again Named One of UK’s Best Workplaces™ for Women

LONDON, July 31, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- For the third consecutive year, leading global data analytics and technology provider Verisk (Nasdaq: VRSK) has been recognised as one of the UK’s Best Workplaces™ for Women by Great Place to Work® UK. The award honours Verisk as a trusted organisation where employees are able to reach their full potential, no matter who they are or what they do.

The UK’s Best Workplaces™ for Women list recognises organisations that are a great workplace for all, including women. Each company on the list supports the different identities women hold and ensures they have positive and consistent experiences. They also recognise that women are a valuable talent pool and strive for fair representation of women in the workforce and throughout management.

Sunita Holzer, Verisk’s Chief Human Relations Officer said: “We’ve designed robust programming to support women’s advocacy, hiring and development as part of our efforts to empower our teammates and create pathways for success across the organisation. This recognition reaffirms our commitment to fostering an inclusive environment where colleagues can thrive, regardless of their gender or role.”

Verisk is committed to the hiring, retention and advancement of women

The Verisk Women's Network, an employee resource group, has built an internal support system and community for women at Verisk and supports efforts to attract, retain and promote diverse talent. The network creates opportunities for career growth and advancement through mentoring, coaching and educational forums. The group celebrated International Women’s Day with a panel featuring Verisk’s female leaders to share their career journeys, advice and insights on today’s environment, and the London chapter regularly hosts networking events and leadership panels. Verisk has promoted gender parity within its leadership and in the boardroom, with women comprising half of the Senior Operating Committee and 40% of the board of directors.

Story continues

Verisk also supports global organizations aimed at furthering women’s professional development, such as Women Who Code and AnitaB.org. For the second consecutive year, Verisk will be participating in AnitaB.org’s Grace Hopper Celebration, the gathering of women and non-binary technologists. Verisk also hosted its second annual Days of Understanding as part of the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion™ initiative. Designed to celebrate diverse perspectives and empower teammates to discuss their unique experiences, the three-day virtual event featured courageous conversations that explore topics like discrimination, allyship and visibility.

This year, Verisk launched the “VeriInspired” series, which showcases the stories of women at Verisk doing great work, building resilience and helping our colleagues and clients achieve incredible things. Each video is designed to evangelize and reinforce the innovative spirit and work sparked and led by women at the company, celebrate diversity and inclusion in the context of work supporting our clients and ‘show’ one of the greatest cultural agents in our organisation—our people.

Verisk’s position on this prestigious list is driven by an employee engagement survey which measured the extent to which women across the organisation reported a consistently great workplace experience, considering factors such as their daily encounters of innovation, inclusivity, company values and the effectiveness of its leaders.

Benedict Gautrey, Managing Director of Great Place to Work® UK, said: “This list celebrates the workplaces that are not just providing a great work environment for all, but are ensuring they’re creating a positive and supportive environment for women too. Each of the companies on our list have been commended by their own female employees who have anonymously told us their workplace has gone above and beyond to ensure that women employees are treated fairly in terms of recognition, training, and promotion opportunities.”

Verisk has earned the Great Place to Work Certification™ in the UK for three consecutive years and has been recognized by Great Place to Work UK as a Best Workplace, Best Workplace for Wellbeing and Best Workplace in Tech.

2023-07-28T19:49:09+00:00,15 Best Stocks Under $15,"In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 best stocks under $15. If you want to skip our take on the economy and the stock market, then head on over to 5 Best Stocks Under $15.

July has been the tone setting month when it comes to the future of the U.S. economy. Throughout the month, multiple data sets have been released which indicate that not only does inflation appear to be cooling down but the economy might also remain resilient enough to avoid a recession that has been feared since mid 2022. The latest bit of economic data, that might have changed the status quo about what to expect from the economy and even the stock market later this year is the fresh GDP report from the Commerce Department. According to this data set, the American economy grew by 2.4% in the second quarter of 2023 - a figure that appears quite remarkable when we consider that output actually reduced in Q2 2022. The 2.4% GDP growth rate marked an acceleration over Q1 2023, and at the same time, while both total and disposable incomes grew, the rate of their growth slowed down as a tighter credit environment takes hold.

The effects of this data on the stock market were rather muted as investors, already wary of the Federal Reserve's relentless tendency to raise interest rates, were fearful that the stronger economy gives the central bank more room to increase the rates by avoiding damage to the economy. In fact, the U.S. economy growth rate data came a day after the bank had raised interest rates by 25 basis points to take them to a 22 year high. As part of comments made with his decision, Fed chairman Jerome Powell pointed out that his staff was not forecasting a recession in the U.S. this year, and considering the rapid rate of interest rate hikes, the bank can afford to take a break and evaluate the economy before it delivers more hikes.

At the same time, if the wage and labor market does not significantly slow down, then the Fed might raise rates even more if it thinks that higher incomes keep inflation above the bank's target range of 2%. On top of prices, the Commerce Department's economic growth data also outlined that the gross domestic purchases price index increased by 1.9% in the second quarter, slowing down from the 3.8% reading in Q1 2023. The Fed's preferred metric, the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index without the impact of food and energy was up by 3.8% for a good drop over Q1 reading of 4.9%.

Another crucial data set that can serve as a crystal ball of sorts for the rest of the year is earnings. Big firms often share their expectations for the short term, and on this front, we're lucky since corporate heavyweights such as McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski shared that his firm has not seen consumer sentiment shift and in fact it might be on a recovery trajectory to meet 2019 levels. This is probably due to the fact that higher disposable incomes have enabled people to keep up spending, and McDonald's is seeing strong interest from people earning between $45,000 and $100,000.

And JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)'s CEO Jamie Dimon and CFO Jeremy Barnum shared their important insights into the economy during the bank's second quarter of 2023 earnings where they shared:

Jeremy Barnum: Yes. So I am sure, Jamie has some views here. But in my in my view, I would just caution against jumping to too many super positive conclusions based on a couple of recent trends. And I think generally our point is less about trying to predict a particular outcome and more about trying to make sure that we don’t get too much euphoria that over concentrates people on one particular predictions when we know that there is a range of outcomes out there. So obviously, we were talking a lot about the potential for a soft lending right now. No lending, neither, it’s inflation or whatever and — whether our own views on that have changed meaningfully. I don’t know, but the broader point is we continue to be quite focused on, Jamie’s prior comments that loss rates still have time to — room to normalize even both pandemics we’re probably over-earning on credit a little bit Obviously, we’ve talked about the expectation that the NII is going to come down quite a bit, so even, forgetting about whether you’ve got some surprisingly negative outcomes on the economy is always today even in the central case, you just need to recognize that there should be some significant normalization.

Jamie Dimon: Yes. I would just add, the 5.8% [unemployment rate] is not our prediction, that is the average of the unemployment under multiple scenarios that we have to use which hypothetical for CECL. Asset predictions on something different and we don’t know the outcome. We trying to be really clear here, the consumer in good shape, their spending down their excess cash. That’s all. Tailwinds. If we go into recession, we’re going with rather good condition, low borrowings and good, our price-value still but the headwinds are substantial and somewhat unprecedented. There is more Ukraine Oil Gas, market, timing, unprecedented fiscal, needs of governments, few team which we’ve never experienced before, I just think people should take a deep breath of that and we don’t know those things because the soft landing in mild recession for our recession. And obviously, sure we will be the best.

2023-07-27T17:49:42+00:00,3 Sleeper Growth Stocks Set to Deliver Explosive Returns in 2023,"Many growth stocks that haven’t aligned with Wall Street’s AI fascination this year have been left out of this “bull market,” even with excellent fundamentals. Once smart money starts scanning the market deeper, many such sleeper growth stocks will start a breakout to the upside. Thus, getting in while they are still in the sleeper phase is a great idea.

I would also like to note that sleeper growth stocks usually have substantial upside potential as many of their positive characteristics are not yet priced in by the market. Even better, they also provide a great margin of safety as they trade below their intrinsic value.

We’ll be talking about the following three sleeper growth stocks:

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

JD.com (JD) the JD.com (JD) logo on the outside of a building

Source: testing / Shutterstock.com

JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is a Chinese e-commerce company with over 580 million active customers. It is China’s biggest e-commerce company in terms of sales, even bigger than Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). Both businesses are very similar; their growth stories and stock prices reflect that. However, what is different regarding JD.com is that the company seems much more secure from the CCP’s crackdown. The same can’t be said about Alibaba, which Chinese authorities have constantly scrutinized.

JD stock reached a peak in early 2021 and has been on the slide since. But recent price action has turned positive, and the momentum implies that a strong U-turn is underway. The company is definitely trading below its intrinsic value, which Gurufocus considers to be at $92. I agree with that price since JD trades at forward earnings multiple of 12.7 times despite nearly double-digit sales growth projections for the next two years.

Even Wall Street seems very optimistic here. The consensus analyst price target is at $61, implying a 55% upside potential.

Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) The logo of the new Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) company on smartphone screen.

Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) is another company sitting at quite a depressed level. It is up 33.8% year-to-date, but it’s still nearly 50% below what this merger previously traded at more than a year ago. This decline is not without its reasons, of course. Warner Bros Discovery has a profitability problem, and 12-month losses sit at a staggering $8.9 billion. Based on the quarterly data, these losses have been trimmed from $3.4 billion in Q2 2022 to $1.1 billion in Q1 2023. Quite the improvement.

Story continues

However, this expenditure also has some good side effects too. Warner Bros has been clearing its debt, and analysts have optimistic projections further down the line. The future 3-5Y revenue growth rate sits at 10.7%, better than 77% of its media peers. But again, bottom-line misses are likely due to Warner Bros Discovery’s aggressive spending on content. It plans to spend $9.5 billion on original content this year.

Regardless, I don’t see Warner Bros Discovery in a cash crunch, and earnings disappointments have mostly been digested. It can also divert some from its massive debt repayment program if it ever needs cash. The stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of 17.8 times. Wall Street analysts recognize that the discount and the average analyst price target imply a 69% upside potential here.

Zoom (ZM) A woman sitting at a desk waves at a large number of people on the videoconferencing software Zoom (ZM).

Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) was well awake during the pandemic era, and the stock traded at nearly $560 in Oct. 2020. However, the pandemic is sliding into distant memory for most people, and so is anything strongly associated with it. Zoom also “came and went,” for most people.

However, that is not entirely true. Not everyone is using Zoom, but there is massive potential here. The stock now trades 30% below even its pre-pandemic peak as Wall Street is busy with more trendy things. But this is a long-term play, and holding it with patience will likely return hefty gains. That’s because the work-from-home trend is still alive. The pandemic did give it a short-term boost followed by a decline, but it is still gaining traction in the very long run. Zoom will be a clear winner from this trend as it is now the first thing that comes to people’s minds regarding video conferencing. The pandemic left this company with a powerful brand and $5.6 billion in cash with meager debt, yet it continues trading at more or less the same level as before the pandemic.

Accordingly, Gurufocus has a very optimistic fair price target of $250 by 2026.

Addictions are usually considered unhealthy and a waste of time and money. It was believed to be true for video games for a while too, but times have changed. Video games have become a great source of income for developers as well as players. For example, in the online multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, Dota 2 players make hundreds to millions of dollars through streaming platforms as well as e-sports tournaments. The game’s currently ongoing tournament, Riyadh Masters (ending June 30) has a prize pool of $15 million while the annual biggest tournament of Dota 2 known as “The International” was able to gather a prize pool of over $40 million in 2021. On top of that, Riyadh Masters’ organizer, Gamers8 has announced their next 2023 event called The Land of Heroes, which is expected to have a prize pool of $45 million, making it the biggest prize pool in the history of e-sports.

The first ever video game was called Tennis for Two and was launched in 1958 by Physicist William Higinbotham. The game was played through an oscilloscope. The idea was revolutionary at the time and was loved by the people at the Brookhaven National Laboratory open house. However, the first commercial game was launched in 1971 and it sold around 1000 - 1500 units. Today, video games remain to be the most profitable industry in the entertainment sector and its market size is estimated to be $245.10 billion in 2023, according to our previous report. Furthermore, the industry is expected to reach $376.08 billion by 2028, registering a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.94% between 2023 and 2028. PC gamers take the lead with respect to the number of users around the globe. In 2022, there were 1.1 billion active PC gamers compared to 611 million console users.

The Rulers of the Industry

Although there are tons of companies in the video gaming industry, there are a few names that stand out the most. The top dogs of the industry include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY), and Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI). Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are technology conglomerates but have significant market share in the video gaming industry, especially with their consoles Play Station and Xbox, respectively.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) covers 60% to 70% of the cloud gaming market which has led to monopolization concerns by authorities. The company announced the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) in February 2022 for $69 billion or $95 per share. However, the deal was blocked by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the United Kingdom’s anti-trust authority. The FTC filed a Motion to withdraw the case on July 18, after losing the battle twice in front of the in-house judge. Both companies are still waiting on passing the hurdle created by UK's antitrust authority which has now paused the the suit and is working on a settlement with the companies. The termination date for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) deal was supposed to be July 18, 2023, but the companies have extended the termination date which was mentioned in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s fourth quarter 2023 earnings call on July 25. The company also announced its plans related to its gaming sector on the same day. The Chief Executive Officer of the company, Satya Nadella, said:

“Last week, we extended our Activision Blizzard merger agreement deadline to October. We continue to work through the regulatory approval process and remain confident about getting the deal done. We are committed to bringing more games to more players everywhere. Great content is key to our approach, and our pipeline has never been stronger. We announced our most ambitious lineup of games ever at our showcase last month, including 21 titles that will be available via Xbox Game Pass. And we're looking forward to the release of Starfield this fall, Bethesda's first new universe in 25 years.”

Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey believes that the success of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) deal could potentially open doors for further acquisitions of companies like Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO), Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), Roblox (NYSE:RBLX), and Ubisoft (OTC:UBSFY). The analyst said:

“We believe that MSFT’s successful acquisition of ATVI could provide a catalyst for further industry consolidation in the video game industry.""

He further added that the potential buyers may include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Tencent (OTC:TCEHY), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY).

Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) also have a significant hold in the video gaming industry. Both of the companies own highly successful and addictive video game franchises. Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) is the developer of Need for Speed, The Sims, and Battlefield series. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) owns one of the highest-grossing video game franchises of all time, the Grand Theft Auto franchise. It is important to note that Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) is currently registering a loss with a trailing twelve-month loss per share of $7.07, but the company is expected to change that soon. The company has announced the launch of the sixth latest installment in the Grand Theft Auto franchise which is expected to release between April 2024 and March 2025. Grand Theft Auto VI is expected to be a game-changer for Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO), considering the success of its last installment, GTA V, which sold over 180 million copies to date.

2023-07-31T21:08:00+00:00,3 Consumer Centric Stocks to Buy as Earnings Approach,"The consumer staples and discretionary sectors highlight several top-rated Zacks stocks set to release quarterly results this week.

Let’s take a look at three of these consumer-centric stocks that will be reproting their quarterly earnings on Tuesday, August 1.

Molson Coors (TAP)

Starting out is Molson Coors which stock currently covets a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Molson may be able to quench investors' thirst for stocks with more upside as earnings estimates are noticeably higher.

Strong quarterly growth is expected for the global beer manufacturer with popular brands including Blue Moon, Miller Life, Coors Light, and Miller Genuine Draft. Molson’s second-quarter earnings are expected to soar 33% to $1.59 per share compared to $1.19 a share in the prior-year quarter. On the top line, Q2 sales are forecasted to be up 12% to $3.29 billion.

Even better, annual earnings are now projected to jump 16% this year and rise another 2% in fiscal 2024 at $4.86 per share. Earnings estimates have continued to trend higher over the last quarter and the cherry on top may be Molson’s 2.32% dividend yield in a space where many stocks don’t offer a payout to shareholders.

Marriott International (MAR)

Higher travel demand has continued to boost hotel chain operators and Marriott International's stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The hospitality leaders' Q2 earnings are expected to climb 21% YoY to $2.19 per share. Sales for the quarter are anticipated at $6.05 billion, up 13% from a year ago.

Annual earnings are now expected to soar 26% this year and rise another 8% in FY24 at $9.14 per share. Earnings estimates have remained higher and Marriott has a modest 1.05% dividend yield to further compel its strengthening outlook. Zacks Investment Research

Electronic Arts (EA)

Lastly, Electronic Arts stock is appealing heading into its fiscal first-quarter earnings report tomorrow and sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The leading interactive entertainment and gaming company is expecting stellar quarterly growth.

To that point, Electronic Arts’ Q1 earnings are expected to skyrocket 215% to $1.01 per share compared to EPS of $0.32 a year ago. First-quarter sales are projected to climb 22% YoY to $1.59 billion.

Regaining the mojo it received from higher gaming during the pandemic, Electronic Arts’ annual earnings are anticipated to climb 25% in its current FY24 and rise another 10% in FY25 at $7.54 per share. Earnings estimates are modestly higher and Electronic Arts offers a 0.55% dividend yield in an industry that is focused on growth and rarely offers a payout.  Zacks Investment Research

Bottom Line

These consumer-centric companies are expected to have posted strong quarterly growth and now may be a good time to buy their stocks for a strengthening outlook. Plus, Molson Coors, Marriott International, and Electronic Arts are leaders in their respective industries and should remain viable investments for 2023 and beyond.

2023-07-31T14:21:00+00:00,Should You Buy Electronic Arts (EA) Ahead of Earnings?,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Electronic Arts EA may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.

That is because Electronic Arts is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for EA in this report.

In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.04 per share for EA, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.01 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for EA, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.54% heading into earnings season.

Electronic Arts Inc. Price and EPS Surprise

Electronic Arts Inc. price-eps-surprise | Electronic Arts Inc. Quote

Why is this Important?

A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).

Given that EA has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Electronic Arts, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.

However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at CrowdStrike Holdings’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.

View our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings

Is CrowdStrike Holdings Still Cheap?

Great news for investors – CrowdStrike Holdings is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $238.79, but it is currently trading at US$156 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. CrowdStrike Holdings’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its true value, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.

What does the future of CrowdStrike Holdings look like? earnings-and-revenue-growth

Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 78% over the next year, the near-term future seems bright for CrowdStrike Holdings. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? Since CRWD is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CRWD for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy CRWD. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.

Last week was marked by significant central bank decisions, leading to increased volatility in the markets. Global central banks are now shifting their policies to be more data-dependent when it comes to rate adjustments. Surprises from the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) have disrupted expectations and caused notable currency movements. Traders are bracing for more volatility in the coming days as they grapple with the implications of the recent central bank actions. The US dollar, euro, and yen are particularly in focus on Monday as investors try to determine if the Federal Reserve and ECB's rate hikes signal the end of their tightening cycles. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan's shift towards a looser grip on bond yields adds further complexity to the global monetary policy landscape. These developments have left investors uncertain about the future trajectory of interest rates and their potential impact on the financial markets.

Oil prices slightly decreased on July 31 but remained close to three-month highs, heading towards the biggest monthly gains in over a year, reported Reuters. The market anticipates that Saudi Arabia will continue its voluntary output cuts into September, contributing to a tightening of global supply. Brent crude futures were down 30 cents at $84.69 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude stood at $80.36 a barrel, down 22 cents. Both Brent and WTI settled on July 28 at their highest levels since April, rising for the fifth consecutive week, supported by tightening oil supplies worldwide and expectations of an end to U.S. interest rate hikes. Saudi Arabia is expected to announce the extension of its voluntary oil output cut of 1 million barrels per day (bpd) for another month including September at the OPEC+ meeting on August 4. Global oil demand reached a record 102.8 million bpd in July, according to Goldman Sachs, which revised up its 2023 demand estimates for India and the U.S. due to stronger economic growth projections, offsetting a downgrade for China's consumption. Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods predicts record oil demand for this year and the next, potentially boosting energy prices in the latter half of the year. In the U.S., the number of oil rigs decreased for the eighth consecutive month in July, with energy firms cutting one rig to reach 529 rigs, according to Baker Hughes' weekly report on July 28.

On the Asian side, the ASEAN nations are collaborating on a cross-border payment system with the aim of promoting financial inclusivity across the region, reported CNBC. Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand have implemented a system that allows residents in these countries to pay for goods and services using their local currencies. This move is anticipated to have several positive impacts, including boosting tourism, increasing consumer spending, and facilitating remittance flows between the nations. Experts predict that the implementation of the cross-border payments system will be particularly advantageous for micro-enterprises, small- and medium-sized businesses, and the unbanked population. On the Chinese front, China's factory activity continued to contract for the fourth consecutive month in July, and non-manufacturing activity also slowed to its weakest level this year. The official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) for July was 49.3, slightly better than the forecast of 49.2 but still below the 50-point level that indicates expansion. Similarly, the official non-manufacturing PMI came in at 51.5 in July, showing a slowdown in activity compared to previous months. China's struggles to revive growth momentum are evident due to soft global demand and insufficient domestic demand. Enterprises reported challenges in the current external environment, with decreased overseas orders and insufficient demand as their main difficulties. These readings point to a challenging economic recovery in China, as top leaders describe it as ""tortuous."" The situation is attributed to various factors, including insufficient domestic demand, operational difficulties for some enterprises, risks in key areas, and a complex external environment.

Meanwhile, across the stock market in the U.S., stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) are getting a huge vote of confidence from the Wall Street analysts.

10. Coursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22

On July 28, Cantor Fitzgerald raised its rating for Coursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR) from Neutral to Overweight, signifying a more positive outlook on the company's prospects. Along with this upgrade, the analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald has set a new price target of $17, which represents an increase from the previous target of $13. The reasoning behind this upgrade lies in Coursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR) robust performance during the second quarter, where it reported ""solid"" results.

Coursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR), as a prominent online education platform, has been gaining traction and popularity among learners worldwide. With its diverse course offerings and accessibility, it has been able to attract a broad user base. As more individuals seek to enhance their skills and knowledge through online education, Coursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR) position in the market becomes increasingly significant.

09. Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25

On July 28, Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI) received an upgrade from TD Securities. The company's rating was raised from Hold to Buy, indicating a more optimistic outlook on Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI) future prospects. The analyst responsible for the upgrade, Steven Green, has maintained a price target of $21 on Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI) shares. This price target represents the level at which TD Securities believes the stock could reach in the future and suggests the potential for significant growth from its current trading price. The upgrade to Buy from Hold suggests that TD Securities believes Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI) stock has a strong potential for appreciation and may outperform the broader market or its industry peers.

Just like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI) is getting a huge vote of confidence from the Wall Street analysts.

Palm Valley Capital made the following comment about Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:

“For the full calendar year, the Fund’s top performers were Coterra Energy (ticker: CTRA), Amdocs, and Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI). Coterra’s stock rose sharply along with energy prices at the beginning of 2022. Amdocs delivered record operating results during the year and demonstrated the strength of its market position serving the world’s leading communication service providers. All the Fund’s precious metals holdings, led by Alamos, contributed positively to performance in 2022, with a 1% collective contribution from gold and silver equities. We think this was a good outcome relative to gold and silver prices that ended the year essentially flat, after a summer swoon. Additionally, precious metals miners were down, on average, in 2022.”

08. Owens Corning (NYSE:OC)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28

JP Morgan analyst Michael Rehaut has recently upgraded Owens Corning (NYSE:OC) from Underweight to Neutral and simultaneously increased the price target from $95 to $133. This upgrade comes as a result of JP Morgan's positive outlook on the company's composite materials and roofing businesses. In a report released on July 28, Michael Rehaut stated that Owens Corning (NYSE:OC) composites margins have already experienced a notable decline in 2022 due to a softer demand environment. However, the roofing margins are expected to remain robust at least through the end of the year. This positive outlook on the roofing segment is likely a contributing factor to the upgrade. Although some investors may still have concerns about the company's elevated margins, JP Morgan believes that Owens Corning (NYSE:OC) stock is trading at a reasonable valuation. The stock is currently valued at approximately 6.6 times the estimated EBITDA for 2023, which represents about a 5% discount compared to the company's five-year average and a 15% discount compared to its ten-year average. This upgrade and optimistic analysis may attract increased interest in Owens Corning (NYSE:OC) stock as the company's prospects appear to have improved, especially in its composite materials and roofing businesses.

07. New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:NYCB)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28

On July 28, JPMorgan upgraded its rating for New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:NYCB) from Neutral to Overweight, signaling a more positive outlook on the company's future prospects. Along with this upgrade, JPMorgan has also increased the price target for New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:NYCB) stock from $13 to $16, reflecting higher expectations for its potential growth.

One of the key factors driving this upgrade is the bank's second-quarter performance, which marked the first full quarter to include the impact of the recently added Signature teams. These newly integrated teams likely bring valuable expertise and assets to New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:NYCB), and their contributions are now more accurately reflected in the financial results.

As a result of having a better understanding of the earnings potential of the combined company with the addition of Signature teams, JPMorgan has revised its earnings estimates significantly higher for the years 2023-2024. This suggests that JPMorgan believes the integration of the Signature teams has positively impacted New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:NYCB) financial performance and could continue to do so in the coming years.

06. The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34

On July 28, BTIG upgraded its rating for The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) from Neutral to Buy with a $103 price target. BTIG believes the company's improving fundamentals could lead to stronger results in the current year and drive faster growth with margin improvement in the future. Initially, BTIG was positive about The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) market position but had concerns about aggressive 2023 expectations. However, their view has completely reversed now. According to BTIG analysts, the programmatic market is growing at a substantial pace of 20% to 25% annually, driven by increased ad spend on lower funnel digital formats and automation outside of search and social platforms. The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) is already established in connected TV and Retail Media segments and is seen as an attractive alternative to DV360, indicating the potential to surpass high-end market growth. BTIG acknowledges that valuing The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) can be complex and evaluated the company using a discounted cash flow method, excluding executive stock-based compensation packages for a comprehensive understanding of its value.

Just like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) is getting a huge vote of confidence from the Wall Street analysts.

Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund made the following comment about The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:

“The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) is the leading internet advertising demand-side platform, enabling programmatic (automated) buying of digital advertising. The company is benefiting from the growth in CTV, while also expanding its market share as advertisers find its neutral positioning in the market attractive; the company only operates on one side of the market (the buy side) as opposed to Google which also purchases ads for its own assets (such as YouTube). Thus, Google operates under a structural potential conflict of interests: on the one hand, its advertising customers are interested in paying as little as possible for the ads they purchase, but on the other hand, its publishing assets such as YouTube, are interested in getting as much as possible for the ads they sell. Trade Desk’s management continues showing excellent performance under an uncertain macro backdrop. In its last quarterly results, the company reported 24% year-over-year revenue growth with 50% adjusted EBITDA margins, while also providing outlook that was slightly above expectations. This revenue growth rate is quite impressive when considered against the negative growth rates reported by most other digital advertisers, including -2% for Google search and -4% for Meta. We believe the company would be a key beneficiary as advertising dollars increasingly shift from linear TV to CTV. We have therefore increased our holding.”

2023-07-29T11:00:43+00:00,"Can Mixed Fundamentals Have A Negative Impact on The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) Current Share Price Momentum?","Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 41% over the last three months. However, we wonder if the company's inconsistent financials would have any adverse impact on the current share price momentum. In this article, we decided to focus on Trade Desk's  ROE.

Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.

Check out our latest analysis for Trade Desk

How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?

The formula for ROE is:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Trade Desk is:

4.0% = US$77m ÷ US$1.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).

The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.04 in profit.

Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?

So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.

Trade Desk's Earnings Growth And 4.0% ROE

It is quite clear that Trade Desk's ROE is rather low. Not just that, even compared to the industry average of 12%, the company's ROE is entirely unremarkable. Accordingly, Trade Desk's low net income growth of 4.7% over the past five years can possibly be explained by the low ROE amongst other factors.

We then compared Trade Desk's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 8.7% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.

Story continues past-earnings-growth

The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Trade Desk's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.

Is Trade Desk Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?

Trade Desk doesn't pay any dividend, which means that it is retaining all of its earnings. This doesn't explain the low earnings growth number that we discussed above. So there could be some other explanation in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.

Summary

On the whole, we feel that the performance shown by Trade Desk can be open to many interpretations. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The low earnings growth suggests our theory correct. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals? Click here to be taken to our analyst's forecasts page for the company.

It was an awful run for stocks in 2022 as inflationary pressures, deteriorating economic conditions, and interest rate hikes rattled investor sentiments. The S&P 500 was on the brink of plunging into bear territory after declining 19.4%. Investors who had sought refuge in low-cost mutual funds were not spared, as most of the funds underperformed amid the steep sell-off in the market.

While a majority of the mutual funds underperformed the S&P 500, some larger cap active mutual funds outperformed owing to their aggressive stock-picking strategies. Actively managed funds performed much better as they strived to outperform benchmark indexes by leveraging the experience of professional fund managers in stock picking.

Active funds outperformed passive funds because fund managers went long on some tech plays that continued to outperform the overall market. The likes of Tesla, Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Alphabet remained resilient, helping uplift most funds.

Active mutual funds outperforming the overall market came as a surprise, given that they have been experiencing sustained outflows since 2010. On the other hand, expectations are high that passively managed funds will make up a majority of US fund assets by 2025.

Even as most of the actively managed funds failed to beat the S&P 500, they underperformed less badly than the previous years. Therefore, it's become increasingly clear that it's difficult for fund managers to beat the indexes over 10-to-20-year periods.

Between 2010 and 2011, between 55% and 87% of actively managed funds could not beat the S&P 500. However, in 2022 only 51% of the large-cap stocks funds failed to beat the index, which was a significant improvement.

Fast forward, sentiments have improved significantly in the equity markets, with most indexes posting double-digit gains. The gains come from improved economic conditions, a pause in aggressive interest rate hikes, and improved prospects of the US economy avoiding recession.

Likewise, some of the large-cap stocks that make up for the biggest share of many large-cap mutual funds holdings are already up by double-digit gains helping propel many mutual funds higher. The likes of Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla are already up by more than 100% over the past six months. Top-Performing Mutual Funds for 10 years

As more investors look for ways to diversify their holdings or investment portfolio, mutual funds have emerged as a preferred investment vehicle. Consequently, the global Mutual Funds market is expected to grow by $71.62 trillion between 2022 and 2027 as it grows at a compound annual growth rate of 9.76%.

Some of the key drivers behind mutual funds' market growth are increased market liquidity, increased share of financial savings, and rising awareness among investors. Consequently, most investors are increasingly turning to stock, bond, and money market funds in the race to gain exposure to the broader financial markets.

The growth of mutual funds in developing nations is another factor behind the 9.76% CAGR growth. Increased adoption of inflations indexed funds, and demand for market transparent should lead to significant demand in the market.

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. U.S. equities continued their upward trend in the second consecutive quarter. The rise was led by the outsized performance of a few large technology companies, partly driven by the hype surrounding their potential benefits from the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). Against this backdrop, the Baron Asset Fund increased by 3.63% (Institutional Shares) trailing Russell Midcap Growth Index’s 6.23% returns.

Its shares increased after reporting robust financial performance during its recent quarter. Overall net new sales grew 18%, driven by accelerated bookings in the company’s multifamily segment, which expanded 110% year-over-year, albeit partially offset by slower growth in its commercial real estate segment. We are encouraged by early signs of traction in CoStar’s nascent residential offering. We estimate that CoStar invested $230 million in this initiative in 2022 and is targeting a total investment approaching $500 million in 2023. While this is a significant upfront commitment, we believe the residential market represents a transformative opportunity for the company. We believe CoStar’s proprietary data, broker-oriented approach, and best-in-class management uniquely position the company to succeed in this large adjacent market.""

Good morning, and welcome Xcel Energy's 2023 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and financial officers. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions if needed. This morning, we will review our 2023 second quarter results and highlights and share recent business developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website.
As a reminder, some of the comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Bob Frenzel.

Robert C. Frenzel

Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everybody. Let's start with our results. We faced some headwinds from weather and other items in the second quarter, recording earnings of $0.52 per share for the second quarter of 2023 as compared to $0.60 per share in 2022. We've got tangible plans in place for the second half of the year to overcome the inflationary pressures as well as the impact of the lower-than-expected ROE in the Minnesota electric rate case and allow us to deliver on our 2023 guidance. But our strategic priorities are unchanged. Leading the clean energy transition, enhancing our customers' experience and keeping our customers' bills low. And we've delivered on this strategic vision across our 8 states for the past decade.
We invest in clean energy resources that provide both financial cost savings to our customers while transitioning to a lower carbon economy. We invest in network infrastructure to foster economic development for new businesses to provide top quartile reliability and to provide resiliency in the face of more volatile and unpredictable weather. We're also building infrastructure to accelerate clean transportation for all of our customers and exploring innovative technologies like batteries and clean fuels to enable the policy objectives and the customer desires for a lower carbon economy, and we focused on continuous improvement to operate efficiently with a lower expense burden to our customers. And as a result, we've been able to keep our operating expenses nearly flat for over the past -- for over a decade.
Our customers benefit from these actions, including significant carbon reductions and residential bills that are 20% below the national average. As you can see, we have a long history of delivering on our commitments to all of our stakeholders and are confident in our ability to meet our earnings guidance again in 2023. This quarter, we made progress on our clean energy transition plans with a growing portfolio of both company-owned resources and power purchase agreements. In our NSP solicitation, we recommended an incremental 250 megawatts of self-build solar generation in a 100-megawatt power purchase agreement. This brings our total company-owned solar projects at Sherco to over 700 megawatts which will utilize the transmission rights for the first of the 3 retiring coal units there.
In the SPS RFP, we recommended a portfolio of 418 megawatts and self-build solar projects and a 230-megawatt power purchase agreement. We're also proposing a battery storage project to one of the new self-build solar facilities. In addition, later in the quarter, we expect to file our recommended Colorado portfolio for nearly 4,000 megawatts of potential resources. And based on our interim analysis, the outcomes should be very beneficial to our customers. Across our 8-state footprint, we enjoy a geographic advantage for wind and solar resources, which enables higher capacity factors. And as a result, Xcel Energy can deliver new renewables at low and competitive prices due to a combination of high capacity factors, IRA tax benefits and the ability to reuse transmission from retiring plants, all of which provides significant benefits to our customers. enables a faster transition to a clean energy economy. Each of these RFPs would represent incremental opportunities as compared to our base capital forecast. We anticipate commission decisions on these proceedings in the second half of 2023 for Minnesota and Colorado, and in the first half of 2024 for SPS.
In May, Breakthrough Energy Ventures announced a $20 million grant to support our 2 10-megawatt pilot projects for Form Energy's 100-hour battery technology. In July, the Minnesota Commission unanimously approved the Form Energy pilot to be installed at our Sherco site alongside our new solar projects. We plan on filing for our second form energy pilot later in the quarter and are evaluating sites that could be supportive of this exciting new clean energy technology. We're also working with the Department of Energy and additional funding opportunities to further reduce the cost of these projects for our customers. In May, we filed our second transportation electrification plan in Colorado, the proposed plan, which covers the 2024 to 2026 period includes expanded solutions and rebates to support new public charging stations and charging at homes, businesses, multifamily buildings and community locations. It also proposes programs supporting electric school buses, innovation and income qualified customers. Our focus is to bring clean transportation to all customers and communities and to expeditiously assist in the build-out of quarter charging to reduce range anxiety of EZ purchasers.
Next month, we plan to file our Clean Heat plant in Colorado and will follow with our natural gas innovation plan for Minnesota during the fourth quarter. These plans will be similar to our electric resource plans and provide a framework for our natural gas system to achieve our carbon reduction goals while meeting the reliability and affordability needs of our customers. Taken as a whole, these innovative projects and partnerships in electricity and clean transportation and home heating are essential for Xcel Energy to meet our sustainability goals and to continue to deliver our customers the safe, clean, reliable and affordable energy that they expect now and long into the future.
In June, the Boulder County Sheriff office announced the findings of its investigation into the cause of the Marshall Fire in December of 2021. Our thoughts continue to be with the families and the communities impacted by this devastating fire, including our own employees whose homes and families were directly affected. The report states that the first Marshall Fire started as a result of an ignition on a property affiliated with an entity called the 12 tribes and that this ignition had nothing to do with Xcel Energy's power lines. The Sheriff's report also discusses a second ignition that started more than an hour after the first fire at a different location, which the report estimates is approximately 80 to 110 feet away from our power lines.
Sheriff's report says that the most probable cause of the second ignition was PSCo's power lines, and we strongly disagree with that conclusion. Because of the pending litigation has been filed, we're not in a position to discuss the Marshall fire in more detail at this time, but we will vigorously defend ourselves and look forward to presenting our position in court. Importantly, additional information about the lawsuits and some of the relevant legal standards is included in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing, and I would direct you there.
Finally, we recently released our comprehensive sustainability report. The report focuses on 4 core ESG pillars: Reach Net Zero responsibly; strengthen our communities; operate with integrity and to value people. It details our progress in achieving our industry-leading ESG goals as well as our priorities moving forward. Some of the key highlights include Xcel Energy has reduced our carbon emissions by 53% since 2005. And more than half of the electricity we provide to our customers comes from carbon-free resources as compared to 41% nationwide. We outperformed the industry reliability standard restoring power to 94% of customers within 24 hours during major storm events. In this past year, in addition to contributing over $10 million to local organizations through the Xcel Energy Foundation, our employees contributed $3 million and volunteered over 74,000 hours for nonprofit and community improvement projects.
We're proud of our track record. It's keeping with our corporate strategy, and it's based on our values of connected, committed, trustworthy and safe. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.

Brian J. Van Abel

Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had earnings of $0.52 per share for the second quarter of 2023 compared to $0.60 per share in 2022. Please note that the line-by-line income statement comparisons are more complicated this quarter as a result of true-ups for the midsole rate case this year in the Texas rate case last year. Most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: Lower depreciation and amortization expense increased earnings by $0.10 per share, largely due to the reversal of deferrals in the Texas rate case last year and the extension of depreciation lives from the Minnesota rate case. These decreases are partially offset by our capital investment program. Lower taxes other than income taxes increased earnings by $0.06 per share, reflecting property tax deferrals in Minnesota and Colorado. In addition, other items combined to increase earnings by $0.04 per share.
Offsetting these positive drivers Lower electric revenues less fuel decreased earnings by $0.23 per share, reflecting unfavorable weather, the impact of the Minnesota rate case and recognition of revenue from the Texas rate case last year. Higher O&M expense decreased earnings by $0.02 per share and higher interest expense decreased earnings by $0.03 per share.
Turning to sales. Year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 0.6%. We continue to expect annual electric sales growth of approximately 1% in 2023, which is driven by growth in C&I sales, partially offset by projected declines in residential sales.
Now shifting to the expenses. O&M expenses increased $14 million for the second quarter. This increase was primarily due to the timing of generation outages, higher bad debt expense, insurance costs and inflation, partially offset by the recognition of previously deferred costs from the Texas electric rate case in 2022. Given these drivers as well as the Minnesota rate case decision, we are taking actions to mitigate O&M, which will include evaluating discretionary programs, staffing levels, consulting, employee expenses, variable compensation and other management actions. As a result, we now expect O&M expenses to decline 3% for the year. 
During the second quarter, we also made progress on several regulatory proceedings. Starting with our completed proceedings. In June, Minnesota Commission approved a 3-year electric rate increase of $311 million based on an ROE of 9.25%, an equity ratio of 52.5% in a forward test year. We plan to file for reconsideration of the decision as we felt the ROE was not consistent with the ALJ recommendation or recent commission decisions in other Minnesota proceedings.
In our South Dakota electric rate case, the commission approved a settlement for approximately $14 million revenue increase. In our pending Colorado Electric rate case, we reached a partial settlement that reflects a $95 million rate increase based on an ROE of 9.3%, an equity ratio of 55.7% (technical difficulty). We expect the commission decision later this summer with rates going into effect in September.
In our New Mexico electric rate case, we reached a contested settlement that reflects a rate increase of $33 million based on an ROE of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 54.7% in the forecast test year. We expect the decision and implementation of final rates by October. Both the Colorado and New Mexico settlements reflect significant.

Question and Answer Session

Brian J. Van Abel

the Minnesota commission will take it up and look at the heart of our reconfiguration filing. And they have 60 days once that -- they have 60 days to decide. So that's the process.

Unidentified Analyst

Got it. Okay. So that should be coming out shortly and then 60 days after a decision whether they take it up or not.

Brian J. Van Abel

Yes. That's up to the Minnesota Commission.

Unidentified Analyst

Okay. And then just you've mentioned the transferability guidance was in line with your expectations. There's been a lot of discussion within the industry, investors and credit agencies on the implications to CFO. I know you're very knowledgeable on this topic in general. So just get your thoughts there, how you're seeing this play out and implications for your credit metrics?

Brian J. Van Abel

Yes. So I mean we've spent a lot of -- I would call it an industry collaboration on how we work this through our financials. And so not only worked with a lot of our peer utilities who've also worked with the big 4 accounting firms. And so every renews going to be in accordance with GAAP, it's going to -- we'll take the income tax approach. It's going to flow through our income tax expense line. That will also flow through cash from operations. And so I think it's pretty straightforward. And I know there's been a lot of discussion whether it will show up in the FFO to debt metrics. So I feel pretty good about it because it absolutely will reflect economics of our underlying financials. And it is -- for us, right, it will be a reoccurring cash flow benefit as we look to monetize these tax credits. So I'm -- I feel pretty good about how it will be reflected across the ratings, and we've spent time with each of those talking them through that. And like I said, also worked closely with the big 4 accounting firms and generally (inaudible) industry will take.

Unidentified Analyst

That's very helpful. And then maybe just to the extent you're willing to comment on this, just a little bit more pointed question on 2023 guidance. Obviously, you mentioned the history of meeting and exceeding expectations. Just with the unfavorable weather and the regulatory decision, where are you tracking and with your sort of cost efforts in place, what are you targeting? Or where are you tracking within that guidance range?

Brian J. Van Abel

Yes. So sitting here today, 6 months of the year, right, we're tracking to midpoint of the guidance. And I'll give you a little bit more color, right? I think about it in kind of 3 buckets. First is execution of our -- on our O&M plans, which I talked about earlier. Second is we build additional rate case revenue that will come in the door in the second half of the year, particularly with the Colorado rate case in light the New Mexico rate case in flight and then there's still continued to benefit from Wisconsin last year. And then we do have expected continued sales growth in our service territories. And so those are really the 3 buckets that I think about it in targeting midpoint of guidance. And obviously, as we normally do in Q3, we will look at where we are in Q3, investing to tighten guidance.

Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin- Smith of Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith

I wanted to focus on the wildfire dynamics. Obviously, a lot of section on this, perhaps principally coming from out of state as well. Can you elaborate a little bit? I know in the prepared remarks, you said you referred us to the 10-Q immediately here, but can you elaborate at least on your insurance levels today, your insurance programs across the states as well as how do you frame the risk here for the lawsuits that have been filed? I imagine that some of the commentary you alluded to in the Q here, but can you help frame up your understanding as well as maybe some of the differences critically from some of the out-of-state considerations that are drawn with new scrutiny?

Robert C. Frenzel

Julien, it's Bob, and thanks for the question. And here's what I can say about Marshall right now. The Boulder County share report concluded that the Marshall Fire first ignited on the property of the 12 tribes and that this ignition was unrelated to our equipment. With respect to the cause of a second ignition which began an hour after the first, we strongly disagree with the conclusion of the share support, and we will vigorously defend ourselves in court. The sheriff's report concluded that there were no design or installation or maintenance defects or deficiencies in public services, electrical circuit in the area of the second ignition.
And so regarding the litigation, there's a hearing in September where we expect to learn more about the procedural next steps, additional information on the lawsuit and the legal standards are included in our disclosures in our earnings release and in our 10-Q. Given the lawsuits, I don't think we're going to comment any further beyond those particular disclosures. I think we're going to stick to our disclosure statements.

Brian J. Van Abel

Yes. And Julien, the insurance coverage is included in our disclosure is approximately $500 million.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith

Got it. All right. Understood. And then any further commentary about the differences in context across different states, especially whether it pertains to legal recovery constructs and/or jury constructs. .

Robert C. Frenzel

Yes, it's all included in disclosures an entire page of disclosures in the earnings release in the queue.

Operator

Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell of Mizuho.

Anthony Christopher Crowdell

Just virtual hopefully 2 quick questions, 1 on Julien -- following up on Julien with the Marshall fire. Is there a timing when that resolves itself? Or you just have to let it play to the courts and you can't give any real feel of when that proceeding will wrap up and that overhang lifted?

Robert C. Frenzel

As I mentioned, look, we have a September hearing where we're going to learn a lot more about the procedural schedule, and we'll know more of that.

Paul Andrew Johnson

Yes. And Anthony, we really can't go beyond what we've already said in the disclosure. So we have to limit the questions on that.

Anthony Christopher Crowdell

Okay. Great. And then on Slide 11, the pending settlement in Colorado. Just -- you talked about, I think, an alternative rate increase $47 million, but that's dependent upon, I guess, coal plant deferrals. I'm just curious if you could talk about how the commission will they hopefully, when they approve the settlement, is that when they will address how they handle the coal plant deferrals? Or does that get rolled into a separate proceeding?

Robert C. Frenzel

No. Anthony, that will all be decided within the rate case decision that the commission will make here in Q3. So they deliver -- they had hearings on it in July, and so it's all part of the record. So it's kind of either the $95 million one or the alternative if you defer some additional depreciation is $47 million. And that $48 million difference is just the deferral of depreciation. So all will be decided.

Brian J. Van Abel

So it would be earnings neutral, but it would have a cash flow impact, obviously.

Operator

Our next question comes from Sophie Karp of KeyBanc.

Sophie Ksenia Karp

A lot of my questions have been answered, but maybe I can just ask a couple of questions here. So on volumes, I'm just curious if you could discuss a little bit what drive the volume variability here like aside from weather -- it seems like C&I volumes were equally or closed equally weak as well as residential. So what are some puts and takes that drive it, I guess, year-over-year?

Brian J. Van Abel

Sophie, yes, if I think about sales and really looking at the weather normalized sales, we continue to see really strong growth on the C&I side out of SPS and in Q2 on a weather normalized basis. We had strength in Minnesota and Wisconsin to Colorado on a year-to-date basis on C&I. There is a large manufacturing facility was down for the first quarter in the first quarter of this year in Colorado. So that had some weakness on the residential side, the residential while we're down close to 1% for the year. It's tracking in line with our forecast or expectations for the year, right? We continue to see good customer growth, but we do see continued use for customer declines as our -- we have really strong energy efficiency and DSM program. So I think overall, it is tracking both on the C&I side and on the resi side, is tracking to expectations for kind of through the first 6 months and for the balance of the year with our guidance on sales.

Sophie Ksenia Karp

All right. And maybe I can just ask the bigger picture question here. I know you've been looking at potentially involvement in operating into 1 of your territories? Just kind of curious how you're still thinking about that and if it's been a new progress to report.

Robert C. Frenzel

It's Bob. We look, we -- as a company, we certainly have a view on nuclear, both current and future. Key priority for us is preserving the existing nuclear fleet and making sure that -- there's a potential for a nuclear future for the country. We have been working with a company called NuScale on their technology. It's an SMR technology mostly helping them through the nuclear regulatory process and making sure that their applications meet the NRC guidelines and hoping to get that, that technology can get through the regulatory process. We don't have plans as a company to own or operate a SMR at this point. We really are just taking our nuclear expertise and helping with the nuclear future for that company with -- so we don't have any specific plans to announce on SMRs in specifics.

Operator

Next question from Carly Davenport of Goldman Sachs.

Carly S. Davenport

Bob, you've been vocal about sort of an all of the above approach kind of on the energy transition from a technology perspective. And you talked a little bit about the grant to support the Form Energy pilot. Could you just talk a little bit about kind of how that pilot is evolving and other opportunities that might exist in that space for itself, if you think about long duration storage?

Robert C. Frenzel

Yes, happy to. Look, as we think about it as a company, first utility to announce 100% carbon free. Given our geographic position, our ability to transition with wind and solar cost effectively for our customers through the end of this decade allowed us to make an interim target of an 80% carbon reduction, we feel very confident in that. But we've always been focused on we need new technology, new research, development and deployment of new technologies to achieve our 100% goal in the nation's clean energy goal One of the big pieces of that is obviously energy storage. 
We have a lot of lithium ion for our batteries around the country, and we have some on our own systems. The long-duration energy storage is a critical part of the energy future. And so the Form Energy battery is a 100-megawatt hour battery. So instead of 4 hours, it's 4 days. And that's a nice asset class as we think about periods when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine. And we've seen evidence of that as recently as early June of this year. In the Southwest, where we had very limited wind production. We've seen it in polar vortexes, where in Winter Storm Uri, where we had no wind production for almost a 3-day period. So this idea of a long-duration battery is really interesting. What's exciting about Form, in particular, it's a pretty old technology really. This was found by the Department of Energy almost 60 years ago. 
But it's becoming commercializable by a new company, Form Energy and they're a breakthrough energy VC-funded company, an Energy Impact Partners-funded company. And the technology is pretty interesting. I want to call it simple because that would minimize the impact and the efforts of the development team and the founders of that company but it's basically resting and de rusting iron. And the great part about that is iron is readily available. It's domestically available, not subject to counter parties and regimes in the world where we have challenges. 
And so when I think about new technologies, sometimes it's not the best that wins, it's the one that's most commercializable and the 1 that can deploy the fastest. And I was really proud to be in West Virginia last month and breaking ground with the Form Energy team with Secretary Grand Home and Sender Mansion. We're building an 800-megawatt capable factory in West Virginia as we speak, with low guarantees and grants from the government. So this is a technology that's going to come to fruition. It's a technology that's going to be scalable. We're really pleased to be their first partner in sales of that, but it's a pilot. It's 10 megawatts and we're going to put it on a 9,000 megawatt system. So we have a great opportunity to build it with them and invest alongside and then the breakthrough energy grants and the potential DOE grants buy down that cost and buy down that risk for the company. So very exciting technology, really excited about the future, what this can mean.

Paul Andrew Johnson

And Carla, I would just add, we have another pilot in Colorado (inaudible), which is a liquid metal technology that we'll have online in 2024. That's a to duration, so kind of call it mid duration. So we're spending a lot of time on this new technology. And I think also longer term, if we kind of broaden the definition of energy storage, green hydrogen is a form of energy storage as we think about longer term, be able to store and then burn it through some of our firm to stash all units longer term. So we're pretty excited about a lot of you call it new technologies and glad really happy to see how excited our Minnesota commission is on form energy with the unanimous approval of that project.

Carly S. Davenport

Awesome. I appreciate those perspectives. And then the follow-up just around earnings guidance, and obviously, you're reiterating the guidance for 2020. I just wanted to check in on temperature on the 5% to 7% long-term guidance. As you kind of think about the incremental spending opportunities from a CapEx perspective along with some of the regulatory outcomes that you've seen kind of how are you thinking about that long-term range?

Brian J. Van Abel

Yes, Carla, good question. And we fully expect to continue delivering in the upper half of our 5% to 7% long-term guidance. So that's unchanged. I think you mentioned the incremental opportunities that we have. And I think in Bob's comments, he mentioned the Sherco Solar free Farm, the SPS, the 418 megawatts of solar farms that are going to provide significant customer benefits in SPS. We filed that CCN yesterday. So those 2 together are north of $1 billion of clean energy investments that will benefit our customers that are outside of our current capital plan.
And I think longer term, right, we'll file here in Q3 or preferred plan or with the Colorado Commission around our RFP going into that, those decided pre IRA with the commission ruled on that resource spend before we could layer on the significant benefits significant customer benefits of the IRA. So when we look at how the costs are coming in relative to what was approved, we believe we will go bigger and faster and above what the initial 4,000 megawatts of renewables in stored showed. So we're excited to work with our Colorado Commission on that, look for that filing in Q3 and hopefully give a decision then even more longer term in the next 18 to 24 months, we'll be filing more RFPs in Minnesota, Colorado and SPS for further significant additions of clean energy assets as we march towards a 0 by 2030 goal. So I'm pretty excited about it, pretty excited about long-term opportunities, and we do feel good about delivering in the upper half of our long-term guidance range.

Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research.

Steven Isaac Fleishman

One marshall fire question. Is there a deadline when any claims need to be filed?

Robert C. Frenzel

Yes. Steve, it's Bob. My understanding is that claims are a 2-year deadline. So that would say the end of this year is when claims need to be filed.

Steven Isaac Fleishman

Okay. Second question, a different topic on the Colorado settlement. Is there -- I know I think you mentioned Q3 for the final orderr. Is there a specific date for that approval?

Paul Andrew Johnson

There's not a date, Steve, but we expect that the commissioner rule probably in the middle of August, whole deliberations in the middle of August.

Steven Isaac Fleishman

Okay. And then lastly, just I know you all have been pretty focused on a number of IRA provisions, including the hydrogen one. And I'm just kind of curious latest thoughts on the ability to look at hydrogen production green hydrogen, all those kind of pillars of the green hydrogen, when do you think you'll get -- we'll get that out and whether nuclear might be included in that or this additionality going to be a problem for that?

Robert C. Frenzel

Yes, Steve, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. We've been very active in clean fuels in general and hydrogen in particular. Look, philosophically, we believe that we're going to undergo a large period of electrification over the next 10 or 20 years as a country and as a company, but that there are parts of the economy that are going to be difficult or expensive or even in some cases, impossible to electrify. And therefore, we feel like we need a clean molecule to help in those areas. And today, that's natural gas. But tomorrow, most promising molecule that we see is a green hydrogen molecule. And this looks like it's an opportunity for the company. It's another version of fuel for fuel at some level. set of government supportive of it. The states are supportive of it. And we've got 2 hydrogen hub applications. One in the Rocky Mountain region with MOUs from 4 states 2 of which we serve Colorado and New Mexico as well as Utah and Wyoming.
And then here in the upper Midwest, 5-state MOU, again, 2 of which 3 of it that we serve, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota and Montana. And we're in front of the DOE, those have progressed through the process, and we expect to know by the end of the year, whether we're going to get duly loan -- grants for hydrogen. And I think you're aware of some of the challenges around what qualifies for a tax credit in hydrogen land. And I think there's sort of 3 areas of sort of debate. And what we're trying to do is balance cost to the customer and a need to accelerate OEMs to build and take us down the technology curve of electrolyzers and balance of plant. And I think about those as location generation matching and then additionality. 
So with respect to location, we've been -- in all 3 of those on 1 end, we think we need flexibility in all 3 of those categories. On the location, we've been supporting as a company, a balancing area type location, but certainly not national, which causes real market distortions and challenges with generation nationally. Similarly on matching, I think that the pure level would say we need hourly matching, but we probably need some transition period to get to that strict hourly matching. And so we've been supportive of some period of time where maybe by the end of the decade or late this decade, we've got hourly matching, but we'll go to annually matching for some period of time. 
And then with additionality, again, very supportive of the additionality as a concept but areas of flexibility there. One, we would really support nuclear in regards to additionality, and we have supported pretty vocally that as well as any sort of otherwise back down energy we would support that as additionality if it came back into the grid. And so very active -- we're very active at EEI, we're very active. And I think those are generally in line with principles that both of those organizations are supporting.

Paul Andrew Johnson

Steve, you asked about timing. The statutory deadline in August 22. And they haven't missed a statutory deadline yet, but what we're hearing is that there's still a lot of uncertainty around the position of it outlined given some of the polarizing viewpoints. So it certainly could slip into September or October.

Our next question comes from Ryan Levine of Citi.

Ryan Michael Levine

In terms of the $500 million insurance, what was the cost of that insurance and when was it occurred? And then I guess, going forward, are you seeing changes in pricing for wildfire-related insurance? And what's your strategy on a go-forward basis related to insurance?

Brian J. Van Abel

W haven't disclosed the cost, Ryan, and every year we renew our insurance program, and we continue to look at that. Insurance program is for everything is based on market experience for the insurance companies. And as you can imagine, it gets more challenged all the time, that's not just related to wildfire, but that's what all we have to say about insurance.

Ryan Michael Levine

Have you already procured it in '23 for the next year? Or is that an upcoming event for the back half of the year?

Brian J. Van Abel

We're still in the process.

Ryan Michael Levine

Okay. And I guess one last question on that. I mean, so the $500 million, any associated costs with procuring it. Is that passed on to ratepayers? Or is that embedded in your O&M cost outlook?

Brian J. Van Abel

It's recovered through rate cases, yes and it's included in O&M.

Ryan Michael Levine

It's included in...

Brian J. Van Abel

It's included in O&M.

2023-07-24T11:00:47+00:00,Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 81% of the company,"Key Insights

Significantly high institutional ownership implies Fastenal's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 25 shareholders own 50% of the company Insiders have bought recently

A look at the shareholders of Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 81% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.

Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.

In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Fastenal.

See our latest analysis for Fastenal  ownership-breakdown

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Fastenal?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Fastenal. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Fastenal, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. earnings-and-revenue-growth

Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Fastenal is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.9% by the third-largest shareholder.

A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.

Insider Ownership Of Fastenal

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Fastenal Company in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$61m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

With a 19% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Fastenal. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Next Steps:

It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Fastenal better, we need to consider many other factors.

I always like to check for a history of revenue growth. You can too, by accessing this free chart of historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.

But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

Fastenal Company misses on earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.52 EPS, expectations were $0.53.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to Fastenal 2023 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would now like to hand the call over to Taylor Ranta of Fastenal Company. Thank you. You may begin.

Taylor Ranta: Welcome to the Fastenal Company 2023 second quarter earnings conference call. This call will be hosted by Dan Florness, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Holden Lewis, our Chief Financial Officer. The call will last for up to 1 hour and will start with a general overview of our quarterly results and operations, with the remainder of the time being open for questions and answers. Today's conference call is the proprietary Fastenal presentation and is being recorded by Fastenal. No recording, reproduction, transmission or distribution of today's call is permitted without Fastenal consent.

A replay of the webcast will be available on the website until September 1, 2023 at midnight Central Time. As a reminder, today's conference call will include statements regarding the company's future plans and prospects. These statements are based on our current expectations and we undertake no duty to update them. It is important to note that the company's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from anticipated results are contained in the company's latest earnings release and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and we encourage you to review those factors carefully. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Florness.

Dan Florness: Good morning, everybody and thank you for our second quarter earnings call. Before I start on Fastenal matters, I'd like to share a message. When I joined Fastenal back in 1996, one of the things that was unique in my joining is that I stepped into the role of Chief Financial Officer, Bob Kierlin offered me the opportunity. And so, I joined in an unconventional way in that I didn't start in a branch or in a distribution center and work my way up through the organization. And sometimes when you join an organization that promotes from within, you're not sure -- kind of reception you'll get when you join. One of the first people I met was Colleen Quad [ph], it was Bob Kierlin sister. She had retired in a retirement.

She worked for Fastenal a few years in sales support. One of the nicest ladies I ever met and we lost Colleen [ph] earlier this year. And to her children and grandchildren, you have my condolences and as well as to Bob on the loss of your sister. What a wonderful lady and we were all blessed to know her. We started back in 67. So our 5 founders aren't in their 20s anymore. And Van McConnon -- Henry McConnon [ph], he goes by Van, he was our first employee. In fact, I think that's how he earned his stake in Fastenal, did well with that stake and I'm proud of them. He lost his wife Wilma earlier in the year and the same message. Van was -- could not have been more of a welcoming person to me when I joined the organization and here is my condolences in the loss of his wife to spring.

With that, I'll move on onto the Fastenal quarter. Second quarter '23 is a challenging quarter. Last fall, when we -- or last December, when we had our leadership meetings and our planning discussions for 2023, the ISM had weakened. We knew that 2023 was going to have some slugging aspects to it. We warned -- we cautioned our team. Second quarter and third quarter will be tough quarters to get through and prepare yourself, prepare your teams from the standpoint that we're going to have to manage our expenses really well. We'll have to keep all of our heads skewed on the right way because there's been -- it's been an interesting number of years between tariffs and COVID and congested supply chains and inflation and all this stuff, there's noise, noise, noise.

We're going to experience something we have experienced for a number of years and that's a slowing economy and prepare for what that means and get the muscle memory back. But it was a challenging quarter. Our earnings came in at $0.52, rising about 4.5%. Softer manufacturing activity led our data sales growth to decelerate. We grew 5.9% in the second quarter. We did not leverage. That's an important element of our business. Our sales grew 5.9% but as we're cycling through some mix changes and Holden, touch on a little more detail. Our gross profit dollars grew about 3.6% and our operating expenses grew 4.1% and I'm not real good with math but I know that's not a good combination if you want to leverage your earnings. And one of the elements is, we didn't anticipate it softening quite as much as it did and that 4.1% needed to be a little bit lower.

We didn't adjust our variable costs quite quickly enough. As we've seen in prior time frames when the economy is weakening and it affects our ability to grow, the high amount of working capital on our balance sheet really can influence our ability to generate cash and given my old role as CFO, second quarter is a painful quarter for us typically because we have 2 tax payments. And when you're a profitable organization, you operate a lot of business in the United States, you pay a lot of good tax. And so second quarter hits us really hard. And normally, we -- for every dollar in earnings, we generate $0.60 to $0.70 in operating cash flow. I don't recall us ever having a second quarter where we generated more cash -- operating cash flow than earnings perhaps Holden will cite an example where we did.

But -- and maybe it was 2009. But that's a strong cash flow as we've ever seen for this time of year. And it also -- and a chunk of it is from not just what's happening in the economy and the working capital needed to fund receivables and to fund inventory for growth. In the last several years as supply chains were really getting congested, the message that I made very clear to our supply chain folks and our teams, we have a covenant with our customer and that is worded supply chain partner, we will not let our customers down in their supply chain. If that means we need an extra 15 and extra 30, an extra 45 days of inventory, don't get ahead of yourself but we need to have inventory to support the business, period. And when the ports on the West Coast of North America were getting congested, the economy is turning back on, everything was getting congested, we beefed up our inventory.

We started -- we were harvesting that. We were doing it in the first quarter. We're doing it this quarter. I think the team has done a wonderful job. It means we have capacity now to look at our balance sheet and say, where does it make sense to make strategic investments in inventory. I'm not saying there's stuff on the table right now but that discussion can be had, whereas a year ago and 2 years ago, we couldn't really even think about it because we were focusing all of our energy on something else. In the second quarter, we made some leadership changes. First off, Jeff Watts, who's led our international -- who joined Fastenal back in 1996, so he's been here for 27 years and started in our Canadian organization when we were -- when we had just a handful of locations in Ontario.

He's led our international sales efforts since 2015 and he will oversee all of our sales efforts across the planet. And obviously, we know each other really well. The team in the U.S. -- international knows them really well because he's led that team for quite a few years. But the U.S. team is no stranger to a 27-year employees. So we know each other well but I believe we'll have greater coordination on our efforts. And Jeff has a very entrepreneurial approach to how he leads a business and I welcome him and look forward to the success he's going to see. Terry Owen, who's been in EVP Operations role, we formalized this role and that he's our Chief Operating Officer. And this bullet was added kind of late in the process. I found out yesterday as a team that I should mention this since we had announced it this quarter.

And there's an error in our release. I thought I'd let you know and it's probably not material in the true aspects of life. But it is Terry has been here 28 years and I know he joined in June of 1999. And if I do the math, I think it's 24. So sorry, we didn't catch that error in our process. But in conclusion, cyclical factors aside, the last several years, we've taken a lot of steps to improve both our labor and our inventory productivity. And I believe this forms an excellent foundation for our ability to generate long-term share gains in the marketplace. Switching to the next page. Onsites, I'll state the obvious. 86 Onsite is a disappointing number. Our aspiration internally has been to drive that to 100 per quarter, 400 per year. That's been our stated aspect mentioned internally.

Prior to COVID, we hit 362 and that was a ramp-up from 80 in 2015 to 176 to 270 to 336 to 362 per year. When COVID came along, it really impaired our ability to sign Onsites because the last thing you want when you're worried about people being around you is inviting a bunch of folks of Blueshirt to come in and operate inside your four walls. And so we saw that drop dramatically. We recovered to about -- we did 356 signings last year. We broke 102 out of four quarters. Perhaps some of the leadership changes we made in the last 60 days created some distraction, perhaps we're not as focused as we should be. But that number needs to be 400 a year or more. And right now, we've adjusted our number. We think we'll probably come in similar to last year, somewhere in the 350s.

And with that said, the fact that our Onsites are up, we have 15% more Onsites than a year ago. That's a great number. We're just not building the pipeline the way we need to. FMI Technology, that's a different story. So, our goal in Onsite is 100 a quarter. Let's get there and then figure out how we take it to 110, 120 but let's get to 100 first. Same with FMI technology, it's not 100 a quarter, it's 100 a day. And I'm pleased to say in the fourth quarter -- excuse me, the second quarter, we did 106 per day. And that's market share gains. That's us going out and planting new flags in new locations to improve the supply chain for our customer, illuminate the supply chain for our customer and us being a great supply chain partner. That's a huge positive.

I believe it tells me the marketplace is conceding the space to us. Maybe I'm wrong on that but I believe it is because we are so far out ahead of the marketplace. Year-to-date, I told the Board yesterday we're with the 106 this quarter -- we had our Board meeting yesterday, with 106 this quarter, we're at 100 year-to-date. I misspoke, we're actually at 99, but I'm really pleased with what the group is doing there. And the 39.8% of our sales went through our FMI platform in the second quarter. News flash, it was 40% in June. So we hit the number -- we hit 40%. Now we need to get to 45% and 50% but continue to see really nice progress there. E-commerce continues to grow handsomely for us and grew about 45% in the quarter. For us, this has been a different journey than other things because a lot of e-commerce is unplanned spend.

If you think about our FMI Technology, that's all about planned spend. That's stuff you're using daily, weekly, every month in your business and it makes sense to stage it accordingly. E-commerce, a lot of that is stuff that you're hopping on to order. So it's unplanned. Historically, not a strong suit for us. And I'm pleased to say it's growing to be a bigger piece of our business. It's, as I mentioned, 45%. The EDI portion of it is up 37% and that's typically larger customers. The web portion of it can be large or small and that's up almost 70%. And to give you a magnitude of how that's changed and again, we're not great at this piece of the business, but we can be. But with that said, in 2015, when I stepped into this role, the web portion of it was less than 2% of sales and we were at $3.8 billion, $3.9 billion of the company back then.

So about $75 million going through web sales back in 2015. In 2023, in the second quarter, it was 6.5% of sales. So right now, we're on a 12-month run rate of about $7.5 billion. So that's a business that's approaching $500 million and we're not that good at it, but we can be. And so it's 6.5x bigger than it was a handful of years ago. And obviously, it's been accelerated by the events of the last few years, COVID is a perfect example. What really accelerated as people do -- some people are working remotely. Some people are ordering a lot more stuff electronically. We're seeing that in our numbers and we're getting better at it every day. And when you push the FMI technology and the e-commerce together and you think about our digital footprint, that was 55.3% of sales in the second quarter of '23, was 47.9% a year ago.

We thought we could get to 65% this year. We've tweaked it to 60%. I don't know if I completely agree with our language there about FASTStock conversions. I think it's really -- part of it is the case of we're doing more and more every day. But some of the activity, because a lot of the FASTStock, for example, is going into fastener installs. It's going into OEM production areas, it's going in the MRO production and we're doing more transactions every day. However, the transactions are a little bit smaller because industrial production is slowing down in our business. And so we might be doing more orders. There are just fewer of them. And I'll cite you a few statistics. In January of 2022, our FASTStock, we did 234,000 scans of orders through our tool which is 11,100 every day.

So our employees are going out with an Android device and scanning 11,100 planograms every day and generating about a $250 order. Actually, it's closer to 260. And then in January of this year, that 11,100 had grown to 14,700 and between January and June, that 14,700 scans per day is now 16,300. That's a combination of market share gains and conversion of -- instead of going out with a yellow note pad, we're going out with an Android device in scanning bins. And so that's a huge win in our system from efficiency. It's a huge win from a standpoint of ability to take market share. But looking at the numbers, our average order size was $258 in calendar 2022. And in January, that number had dropped to $246. So it was down about 4.7%. And I think there's enough transactions going on there that, that's probably more a tone of the economy than anything else because when you're doing 300,000 a month, it's not a mixed thing. Bolts, Tools, Screws, Hardware

Between January and June, the $246 order dropped about $222, so it's down $24 which is 9.6%. That's primarily activity that's declining in the industrial marketplace. And there might be an element between January and June of a little bit of deflation because there's some fasteners in there, but it's mostly about activity. Just thought I'd share those start to get in the weeds. And I will share one last thing before I turn it over to Holden. And that is, again, this FASTStock tool, this Android device that we have out there. In October of -- excuse me, in the summer and fall of 2019, we did a beta version out in the Southern California of that device and work through some bugs, work through some bugs and started rolling it out to regions late in the year with a planned 2-year rollout.

COVID-hit and we accelerated that rollout and we rolled it out across the company by June of 2020. So, we rolled -- we had a 2-year rollout in 6 months. And today, that's about 12% of our revenue. The -- in October of this year, we plan to roll out what we call our order pad which will be on the same device. It will be an internal-facing device and use it in beta for -- in the October time frame. If all goes well, our goal would be to roll it out in Q4. And essentially, it's a tool for our personnel when they're out visiting a customer, not only can I take a recurring order, I could easily take a customer asking for something or I can do a search on it and I can respond to the customer right in front of them. That's a capability we've never had and we plan to have -- we expect to have that by the end of this year for 2024.

A second piece, that's an internal facing app. We've also developed an external-facing app called FASTScan, it's with beta customers right now. Our goal is in August to have that out in the Apple store and the Google Play for customers. If they choose to download that and that would be a bin stock app for customers. It's primarily smaller customers or customers that might be a few hours from a facility in Montana or in Western Canada, where they can do some bin stock scans themselves, transmit the orders so when we visit, we aren't surprised by a stock out and it makes for a better supply chain for that customer base. That will be, again, coming out in August. And depending on what we -- the success we find with our order pad, our goal would be next summer to roll that out in the customer-facing app as well.

Again, we're not great at the web portion of our business. It's a $0.5 billion business within Fastenal now but we can be and we're building tools to do that because we think that's a better reaction to some of the buying habits that's going on in the marketplace. With that, I'll turn it over to Holden.

Holden Lewis: Great. Thanks, Dan. One loose thread there perhaps to pull a little bit. Last time we had cash conversion of this level. It was actually in the second quarter of 2020. For those who don't remember the second quarter of 2020, there was an event occurring at the time that we now know as the pandemic. But I really think it reinforces the point. It took a once-a-century event to create a second quarter that despite several tax payments, produced cash conversion in that 100% range. And the fact that our teams are able to do that in a quarter where thankfully, there has not been anything remotely looking like a pandemic. Again, I think really gets to the success of the teams in managing kind of the post-pandemic environment.

So yes but it does take a condition of that sort. Jumping into the details on Slide 5 of the deck. Daily sales increased 5.9% in the second quarter of 2023. Since March, we have seen overall business activity moderate which culminated in June daily sales growth of up 4.7%. The most meaningful change in trend has occurred in our manufacturing customer. This segment grew 10.4% in the period despite sustained sub-50 PMIs and flat to negative industrial production. This reflects the impact of our investment in Onsite and greater sales focus on key account plan spend which tends to be significant within manufacturing. Even so, we did experience weaker sequential in May and June that represents a macro-driven change from the long string of strong sequentials that we had from 2021 to February of this year.

As it relates to pricing, they contributed 190 to 220 basis points to growth in the period, declining approximately 470 basis points from the second quarter of 2022 and approximately 100 basis points from the first quarter of 2023. This trend is not a surprise and will likely continue in the second half of 2023. Other factors cited in recent quarters, specifically weakness among some large retailer customers, lack of growth in our rest of world geography and contraction in our construction end market remain factors in the current quarter but the dynamics around these areas were largely unchanged from prior periods. While we continue to pursue key account plan spend in construction, this market has historically had a disproportionate amount of smaller transactional spend where we are currently putting less emphasis.

We believe this shift contributes to manufacturing outgrowth, better labor leverage and better asset efficiency. We have experienced manufacturing-driven weak sequentials in 3 of the last 4 months. Regional leadership continues to characterize customer sentiment as cautious with greater scrutiny over operating and capital spending and some mention of slower or deferred orders. As usual, we have limited forward visibility but most indicators seem to be pointing to the immediate outlook remaining soft. Now to Slide 6. Operating margin in the second quarter of 2023 was 21%, down from 21.6% in the prior year. The incremental operating margin was 11%. Gross margin was 45.5%, down 100 basis points in the prior year. This decline is almost entirely due to product and customer mix as we experienced widening sales growth outperformance of non-fasteners over fasteners and of Onsite growth over non-Onsite growth.

Freight was favorable gross margin, reflecting record freight revenues that allowed for good leverage of our captive fleet, reduced use of external freight providers, lower fuel expenses and reduced shipping costs. The benefits of freight were offset by higher organizational or GAAP expenses. Reductions of purchasing and shipping activities of imported products, stemming from a smoother and more predictable supply chain relative to the year ago period caused higher prior period cost to be relieved from the balance sheet to the P&L. The impact of price cost was immaterial to gross margin in the second quarter of 2023. On the operating expense side, we produced 40 basis points of leverage which was not sufficient to fully offset the decline in gross margin.

This was due entirely to payroll expenses, of which we experienced 60 basis points of leverage which was related to lower incentive compensation of last year's record level. This was offset by modest deleveraging of both occupancy costs and other expenses. There were 3 distinct elements playing out in our operating margin in the second quarter of 2023. First, I alluded to the GAAP expenses. The GAAP expenses had the convergence of a difficult comparison, aggressive inventory reductions and shortening product order cycles. This alone is a 50 basis point negative impact and is unlikely to repeat by anywhere near the same magnitude in the second half of 2023. Second, certain expenses such as 16% growth in IT spending and 13% growth in cost for FMI devices represent planned and prudent investments in our business, the impact of which is magnified by the slower sales growth environment.

Third, the Blue Team did not adjust spending quickly enough to the slower macro environment with the variable cost for meals, travel, supplies, all increasing double digits. Also, while lower incentive compensation produced leverage in the second quarter, we continue to have growth in headcount and part-time hours that exceeds sales growth. I would expect us to tighten this spending appreciably in the third quarter of 2023. Putting everything together, we reported second quarter 2023 EPS of $0.52, up 4.6% from $0.50 in the second quarter of 2022. Turning to Slide 7. We generated $302 million in operating cash in the second quarter of 2023 or approximately 101% of net income in the period. Traditionally, normal second quarters have a conversion rate in the 60% to 70% range.

So this is a strong cash performance relating to a reduction in the use of cash for working capital versus the prior period. This allowed us to reduce debt with debt ending at 9.4% of total capital in the second quarter of 2023, down from 13.7% in the first quarter of 2022 and from 10.9% in the first quarter of 2023 -- I apologize, 13.7% in the second quarter of 2022. Year-over-year accounts receivable was up 6.1%, largely tracking sales growth with the impact of mix due to faster growth from larger customers which tend to have longer terms being offset by improved receivables quality. Inventories fell 6%. This is a function of normalized supply chains, allowing us to unwind inventory layers we had built up in late 2021 and early 2022 to manage that period's product bottlenecks.

That process will likely continue, though likely to a lesser degree, throughout 2023. It is also notable that our days on hand fell to 138.5, a level not seen since 2002 which reflects improved velocity of inventory through our internal network, a reduction of retail stock in branches and improvements in stocking processes. We have significant strategic flexibility in inventory at this point. We have retained our range for net capital spending in 2023 of $210 million to $230 million, reflecting higher spending on hub investments, fleet equipment and IT equipment. At the same time, we have deferred certain projects related to slowing demand that suggest our capital spending will be at the low end of the range. The second quarter of 2023 was obviously challenging.

We expect to have better cost comparisons and to more tightly control those costs that we can affect in the second half of 2023. Obviously, we have little control over end market demand. Whatever direction that takes over the next 6 months will influence our profitability. However, these shorter-term issues shouldn't cloud the structural improvements to our business. The second quarter saw record labor productivity they create some significant strategic flexibility in our inventory and further improvement in our return on capital, as reflected on Page 9 of the investor presentation. We believe we are positioned to strongly outgrow the market, particularly as the industrial cycle stabilizes and improves. With that, operator, we'll turn it over to begin the Q&A.

Significantly high institutional ownership implies GE HealthCare Technologies' stock price is sensitive to their trading actions 50% of the business is held by the top 7 shareholders Insiders have been selling lately

A look at the shareholders of GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 61% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).

Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.

In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of GE HealthCare Technologies.

View our latest analysis for GE HealthCare Technologies  ownership-breakdown

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About GE HealthCare Technologies?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

We can see that GE HealthCare Technologies does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of GE HealthCare Technologies, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. earnings-and-revenue-growth

Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in GE HealthCare Technologies. General Electric Company is currently the largest shareholder, with 14% of shares outstanding. With 10% and 7.9% of the shares outstanding respectively, Capital Research and Management Company and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.

We also observed that the top 7 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

Insider Ownership Of GE HealthCare Technologies

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Our information suggests that GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$60m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.

General Public Ownership

With a 25% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over GE HealthCare Technologies. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.

Public Company Ownership

Public companies currently own 14% of GE HealthCare Technologies stock. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.

I Worked at Dollar Tree: Here Are 5 Insider Secrets You Should Know

Earning more is not always an option if you are already putting in long hours and barely making ends meet, especially if you have other responsibilities like caring for young children or aging parents. Investments with higher returns tend to be risky, which is okay if you still have a lot of time until retirement.

For many people, finding additional ways to save on necessities like food and household goods is the best way to free up money to save for retirement. GOBankingRates recently outlined how you can save more than $300 per month by shopping at Dollar Tree. Let’s look at what real people are buying at the dollar store — where most items are now $1.25 — and how to invest that money wisely.

How To Save at Dollar Tree

Dollar Tree is known for its low prices on craft items, seasonal decor and party goods such as paper plates. But some shoppers also save money on food, cleaning products and laundry soap.

Melissa A. Kay, a freelance writer in Deer Park, NY, said she likes Dollar Tree for gourmet items she wouldn’t splurge on in a grocery store, such as oat milk and hazelnut spread. “I probably wouldn’t have bought oat milk at the grocery store, because it’s so expensive there,” she said.

For the most part, she tries to be careful only to buy items that are part of her normal grocery shopping trip, such as crackers, pretzels, applesauce and cans of tuna. Kay said she compares prices carefully. “Sometimes the items at Dollar Tree cost more than they do at the grocery store. For example, a can of chickpeas was cheaper at the grocery store.”

Several dollar store shoppers mentioned pretzels as a tremendous value at Dollar Tree. “Dollar Tree sells super pretzel nuggets for $1.25 when the local supermarkets are selling them for like $4+ depending on the store. So we buy them at Dollar Tree all the time. Same with Snyder’s butter snaps,” said TommieLynn Mulderig, a mom-of-one on of Long Island, NY.

As Dollar Tree introduces more name-brand items, it offers more opportunities for shoppers to save. Overall, Kay said she saves roughly $25 a trip compared to the grocery store. It’s not a lot, but if you were to invest an extra $25 every month at just 7%, you’d have more than $12,000 extra in 20 years, according to the calculator at Saving.org.

Holly Kristine-Carman, who works in direct sales and runs the Facebook group Reclaim Your Power to inspire women, says she saves close to $180 per month buying groceries at Dollar Tree. “I buy mostly frozen foods for the boys,” said Kristine-Carman, who has four children and two grandchildren.

On a recent trip, she spent $60 on frozen pizza, egg rolls, burritos and cleaning supplies. “At Walmart, I would have spent at least $150 on all of that,” she said.

She shops at Dollar Tree roughly twice a month to keep her freezer stocked. “Burritos and pizza and sandwiches are so quick and easy to put in the microwave when they want to snack. That way, I don’t have to stop and cook something if I’m working or if I have the grandkids.”

So How Much Can You Really Save for Retirement?

With savings ranging from $25 per month up to $300 a month or more, it’s easy to see that your savings may vary if you’re shopping at Dollar Tree. But if you can take that savings — no matter how small — and invest it, you can see some solid returns.

For instance, if you aggressively invest $300 a month in the stock market at a 12% rate of return, you could have more than $1 million saved in 30 years.

Depending on your situation — and if you are facing retirement in the next 10 to 15 years — it might be better to invest your savings in a 401(k), especially if your employer matches funds. However you invest it, applying your shopping savings to high-yield investments can help you get closer to your retirement goals.

Are you a diehard Dollar Tree shopper? I used to be, as well. I’d buy everything from paper goods and seasonal decorations to school supplies and, often, groceries and cleaning products. Depending on where you live, Dollar Tree has a surprising amount of fresh and shelf-stable groceries for just $1.25 up to $5.

I Worked at Dollar Tree: Here Are 5 Insider Secrets You Should Know
Learn: How To Get Cash Back on Your Everyday Purchases

Then Aldi and Lidl opened up just a stone’s throw from my home and they became my go-to markets for virtually everything on my grocery list. Of course, prices range much higher than $1 at these affordable grocery stores. But you can find everything you need — including fresh meats, poultry, and produce — which saves gas and time. Sometimes, saving money is also about shopping more efficiently.

I have some tips to help you toss away that “Aldi anxiety” and become a pro Aldi or Lidl shopper to maximize your savings.

Be Willing To Experiment

Although you can find certain name brand items, including Arizona Iced Tea, Doritos chips and Hellmann’s Mayonnaise at Lidl, both stores specialize in private-label brands. Don’t be afraid to try Lidl and Aldi brand merchandise.

Know Your Brands

It helps to know the private label brands at each store. Lidl markets most of its items, including frozen vegetables, butter, condiments and spices under the Lidl name. But it also sells Peak Harvest brand fresh fruits and vegetables. You’ll find premium products like extra virgin olive oil and Marcona almonds under the Preferred Selection line.

Aldi sells L’oven Fresh breads and Happy Farms dairy products, including a legendary selection of cheese, and Clancy’s snack products. Aldi also carries their own Simply Nature line of organic and/or non-GMO groceries.

Keep Track of Family Favorites

Some of the private label products are just as good as — or even better than — their name brand counterparts. For instance, I stock up on Lidl butter when it’s on sale, and we go through a few bags of almonds and macadamia nuts each week in my house. My picky daughter loves Lidl pasta. But my son takes a hard pass on the Lidl macaroni and cheese. Fortunately, Lidl also carries the classic Kraft Macaroni & Cheese for just a little more per box than the store brand.

Check Dates on Meat and Dairy

Many people shy away from meat, poultry and seafood at Lidl or Aldi. But I’ve gotten some incredible deals and found the quality to be as good as you’ll find at other stores. I especially love the Lidl grass-fed ground beef, usually $5.99 a pound or less, and the sirloin steaks.

I have accidentally purchased expired bacon from Aldi, but that can happen at any store. It’s just a good idea to always check dates on meat and dairy before you buy. Grab products from the back of the case, when possible, since they are likely to be fresher.

Shop on Wednesday

Both Lidl and Aldi release their sales and re-stock non-food merchandise on Wednesday, so that’s the best day to shop. Ideally, you’ll want to get there as early as possible to avoid crowds.

You can also use Google Maps to discover when the store is most crowded or least crowded. Shopping in an empty store is less stressful so you’re likely to take more time to check prices and avoid impulse purchases.

Use the Lidl App

You can stack the savings when you use your Lidl app. The app lets you browse the weekly ad right on your phone, create a grocery list and ad store coupons to the app. You’ll earn rewards the more you spend. For instance, right now I have 20% off select nuts and cashews (which will be helpful for restocking our macadamia supply) for spending $50 in two visits this week.

Avoid the ‘Aisle of Shame’ (Except if You Have a Purpose in Mind)

Aldi’s “Aisle of Shame,” that section in the center of the store with home décor items, children’s toys, and even clothing, is famous, with Facebook groups devoted to the deals. Lidl has a similar section, typically located near the back of the store across from the dairy section on the back wall.

It’s best to avoid this section if you want to keep your list focused on groceries and avoid impulse buys. But, if you are looking for something specific, you might be surprised by the deals you’ll find, from patio furniture to pajamas.

Know the Differences Between the Two Stores

As much as people compare these competing stores – which are not owned by the same parent company – there are significant differences. Understanding the differences can help you decide where to shop.

Lidl has a cold cut counter with fresh sandwich meats at bargain prices and also a bakery with an extensive collection of fresh-baked breads, pretzels and legendary croissants. Lidl also sells beer and hard seltzer, including craft and German beers you won’t find in other places alongside mainstream choices.

In certain areas, Aldi is known for its Winking Owl wine, but in some regions, you won’t find any alcohol on the shelves.

Lidl’s meat and produce sections are larger than Aldi’s, akin to what you’d find in a regular grocery store.

Neither store provides bags. And, of course, you’ll need to bring a quarter if you want a cart at Aldi, which is not the case at Lidl.

Do All Your Shopping at One Place

The key selling point to these stores over Dollar Tree is that they are a one-stop shop for all your household and grocery needs. You can buy personal care items, fresh meat and produce, beverages, and more. If you try to do your grocery shopping at Dollar Tree, you’ll probably need to make at least one more stop at a traditional grocery store.

Aldi and Lidl can even replace some of your Target stops with the merchandise they sell.

My favorite recent Lidl find? Back-to-school supplies are cheaper than Target, Walmart, or Staples, with 15-cent folders and 24-count boxes of Crayola Crayons for just 25 cents.

2023-07-25T00:36:34+00:00,7 Chip Stocks to Sell Before Nvidia Crushes Them,"With the AI boom, investors are searching for the next Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). While there are some that could rival the tech giant, many chip stocks are unfortunately falling into the category of top chip stocks to sell.

There’s a reason why this secular growth trend has boosted NVDA more than threefold since the start of the year. Already capitalizing on rising demand for chips capable of running generative AI platforms, Nvidia is the undisputed first mover in this space. Comparable names are attempting to play catchup, but in the end may only (at best) derive a moderate benefit from this tailwind. That’s bad news for other AI chip stocks that have experienced high double-digit or even triple-digit rallies riding NVDA’s coattails.

Alongside this, there are semiconductor companies that, while not directly competing with Nvidia, and in some cases partnering with the company, that stand to derive modest-at-best benefits, or have other issues that outweigh the positives stemming from AI.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

With this, let’s take a look at the seven chip stocks to sell due to NVDA’s AI dominance, and why exactly is it best to avoid these stocks.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Figurines of two little men in suits looking at downward stock arrow going through the floor. overvalued stocks

As Nvidia’s key peer, many assume that the generative AI trend bodes well for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). This explains why shares in this popular chip play have also gotten out of their tech sell-off slump this year. Since Jan. AMD has rallied 73.3% higher.

However, this big run-up with AMD stock is bad news for investors that may be considering it “the next Nvidia” in terms of stock price performance. With this big jump in price, AI tailwinds have become strongly factored into its valuation. Perhaps, too strongly.

As I recently argued, capitalizing on AI remains a work in progress for AMD. My InvestorPlace colleague Dana Blankenhorn is even more pessimistic, arguing that playing catchup is a lot easier said than done. Put simply, expectations are already baked-in, and non-AI headwinds (weak demand in other end-user markets) persist. Steering clear of Advanced Micro Devices right now is the better move.

Globalfoundries (GFS) Grayish photo of investor's hands hovering over laptop with red stock graph showing downward arrow overlayed on top of the image

Globalfoundries (NASDAQ:GFS) is also one of the top chip stocks to sell. As Zacks Investment Research recently pointed out, both Nvidia and AMD (ironically GlobalFoundries’ former parent) are sticking with overseas contract manufacturers for the production of their advanced chips. Meanwhile, this foundry largely makes chips for the end user markets experiencing demand weakness right now.

This could change down the road. Geopolitical tensions may lead to a “re-shoring” of advanced chip manufacturing back to the U.S. That will of course be a positive for this company and for GFS stock. However, the possibility of this is hardly a reason to pay 29.5 times forward earnings for a foundry that’s anything but “crushing it” right now.

Intel (INTC) little girl holding a stock chart with athumbs down. tech stocks

Selling chip stocks that are set to lose as Nvidia gains? Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) belongs at the top of that list. Sure, it’s old news that semiconductor “dinosaur” Intel has been losing out to its higher-flying chip rivals for years, resulting in sluggish growth.

Not only that, investors have clearly priced-in the impact of falling profitability (due to the current chip glut) into the price of INTC stock. Some contrarian investors have made this a bottom-fisher’s buy, on the view that Intel’s multi-billion gamble on becoming a chip foundry will pay off in a big way. However, as I pointed out recently, Intel’s chip foundry pivot is bound to disappoint.

Spending billions to penetrate this lower-margin, commodified industry isn’t likely to result in INTC getting out of its slump. Although it would still be a gamble, perhaps it would be better if Intel was making a big AI pivot instead.

Micron Technology (MU) a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrow

Why does the success of the AI chip first mover mean bad news for Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU)? After all, does this maker of memory chips have an AI tailwind of its own? Yes, this is true. Last month, the company reported better-than-expected quarterly results, due to demand for memory chips in generative AI servers. However, MU stock is one of many chip stocks to sell, due to AI-related demand boosts being far outweighed by the continued slump in demand among other types of end users.

Memory chip demand challenges are expected to keep Micron in the red during both 2023 and 2024. While a rebound among non-AI end users, coupled with AI-related growth, could swing Micron back into the black by 2025, much of this may already be accounted for in MU’s valuation, following the stock’s more than 30% rise in price since Jan.

Qualcomm (QCOM) earnings

Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is another chip stock that appears to be a potential AI winner on the surface. However, if you look closer, other weaknesses make it questionable as an AI play.

The mobile chip maker has hopped on the AI bandwagon, touting its potential to eventually become a leading supplier of AI-capable chips for smartphones and Internet of Things (or IoT) devices. Couple this potential, with the low valuation of QCOM stock (15 times forward earnings), and you may think that this is an AI bargain, hiding in plain sight.

However, there may be a good reason why QCOM is so cheap. At least, that’s the view of Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research Team. In their view, there are numerous headwinds that will likely continue to outweigh Qualcomm’s pivot. Said issues could also weigh again on shares, making this a stock to sell before the next drop.

Samsung Electronics (SSNLF) a keyboard with a greet enter key marked sell, representing overvalued stocks to sell

Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) technically trades in the U.S. over-the-counter (or OTC) market. However, don’t assume this means you can grab shares in this South Korean-based electronics giant, which is one of the largest manufacturers of advanced chips. There has not been a trade of SSNLF stock stateside since last Sept. More importantly, beyond the fact that you likely cannot buy Samsung Electronics if you can only buy U.S.-listed stocks, even if you can access the company’s South Korean-traded shares, you may want to consider this one of the chip stocks to avoid.

As The New York Times reported earlier this month, even as global investors pile into the stock, on the view that its “AI moment is here,” analysts are not so sure. It’s easy to see why, given that, similar to Micron, memory chip headwinds far outweigh any AI tailwinds for Samsung Electronics right now.

Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) sell written on a chalkboard representing overvalued stocks to sell

Source: Shutterstock

Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is another name you may question being a “stay away” chip stock due to Nvidia’s rise. After all, this is the contract manufacturer for Nvidia’s AI chips.

But while Nvidia is gaining big from off-the-charts demand, according to one analyst (JP Morgan’s Gokul Hariharan), this isn’t exactly a big bonanza for this top chip foundry. Per Hariharan, only 5% of the company’s revenue this year will come from making AI chips for Nvidia and other fabless chip companies.

That’s not all. Other factors call into question the made rush into TSM stock, which is up by 31.4% this year. Major issues loom over Taiwan Semiconductor, and not only the obvious geopolitical ones. As seen in TSM’s latest earnings, this is yet another chip stock where demand challenges in areas outside of AI fail to make up for the small demand boost related to the trend.

2023-07-26T11:00:15+00:00,Is Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM) Expensive For A Reason? A Look At Its Intrinsic Value,"Key Insights

The projected fair value for Atlassian is US$132 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Atlassian is estimated to be 35% overvalued based on current share price of US$178 The US$187 analyst price target for TEAM is 42% more than our estimate of fair value

Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.

Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.

View our latest analysis for Atlassian

Step By Step Through The Calculation

We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.

Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:

10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast

2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$989.9m US$1.29b US$2.00b US$2.14b US$2.24b US$2.33b US$2.40b US$2.47b US$2.54b US$2.60b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x17 Analyst x11 Analyst x2 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 3.71% Est @ 3.23% Est @ 2.89% Est @ 2.66% Est @ 2.49% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1%  US$916 US$1.1k US$1.6k US$1.6k US$1.5k US$1.5k US$1.4k US$1.3k US$1.3k US$1.2k

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$13b

The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.1%.

Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.6b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.1%) = US$45b

Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$45b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$21b

The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$34b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$178, the company appears potentially overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf

The Assumptions

Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Atlassian as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.002. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

Looking Ahead:

Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.4% gain on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.52%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 10.86%.

Heading into today, shares of the company had gained 7.39% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 2.6% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.98% in that time.

Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Atlassian as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be August 3, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Atlassian to post earnings of $0.43 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 59.26%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $911.23 million, up 19.92% from the prior-year quarter.

Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Atlassian. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.

Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.

The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Atlassian is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Atlassian has a Forward P/E ratio of 82.74 right now. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 43.41.

It is also worth noting that TEAM currently has a PEG ratio of 4.14. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Internet - Software industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.81 as of yesterday's close.

The Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 65, putting it in the top 26% of all 250+ industries.

2023-07-30T13:00:19+00:00,This Illumina Insider Reduced Their Stake By 12%,"Insiders were net sellers of Illumina, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ILMN ) stock during the past year. That is, insiders sold more stock than they bought.

While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.

Check out our latest analysis for Illumina

Illumina Insider Transactions Over The Last Year

Notably, that recent sale by Chief Commercial Officer Susan Tousi was not the only time they sold Illumina shares this year. Earlier in the year, they fetched US$210 per share in a -US$1.0m sale. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$192. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).

Susan Tousi sold a total of 6.00k shares over the year at an average price of US$206. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date! insider-trading-volume

For those who like to find winning investments this freelist of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.

Illumina Insiders Are Selling The Stock

Over the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Illumina. Specifically, Chief Commercial Officer Susan Tousi ditched US$1.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.

Insider Ownership

Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It appears that Illumina insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$47m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.

So What Does This Data Suggest About Illumina Insiders?

An insider hasn't bought Illumina stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. Insider ownership isn't particularly high, so this analysis makes us cautious about the company. We're in no rush to buy! In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Illumina. For example - Illumina has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.

2023-07-29T13:08:21+00:00,Biotech Battlefields: 3 Stocks to Watch Amid Wall Street Turmoil,"As biotech stock prices have fallen, Wall Street and biotech boards have grown increasingly unfriendly. Amid the turmoil, key biotech stocks have become the targets of activist investors demanding new executives, new boards and new strategies. The specifics of each case vary, but the biotech stocks in sharpest focus have been those whose earnings and revenue have disappointed investors.

Of course, it’s no accident this happens. Investors want to protect their investments. And if the company isn’t acting right, they are well within their rights to try to change. If their changes succeed, it could prove a key turnaround for a company’s future. Many high-potential biotech stocks could see themselves skyrocket after these changes — and investors know it.

But companies will always fight back. Change doesn’t happen easily, and overturning the inertia of the board, the executives and other shareholders takes time — sometimes quite a while. But these biotech stocks can still benefit from showing resilience during the turmoil and ending uncertainty afterward. A keen investor knows that a crisis is also an opportunity.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Ultimately, it’s important to know what’s at stake, whether you side with investors or companies. So, amid the turmoil, here are three high-potential biotech stocks to watch.

Biogen (BIIB) BIIB stock: Biogen Factory Building in: Luterbach Solothurn Switzerland

Biogen’s (NASDAQ:BIIB) most promising drugs, Aduhelm and Leqembi, were expected to be game-changers. But investors have not been impressed. Both drugs are monoclonal antibodies designed to target beta-amyloid — a protein found clumped together in those with Alzheimer’s disease. Biogen’s initial rollout of these drugs generated significant excitement, but investor concerns led to a failed investor lawsuit and a new chief executive officer (CEO).

The controversy centered around the slow uptake of both drugs. Concerns about limited efficacy and potentially life-threatening side effects like brain bleeds have led some doctors to hesitate in prescribing them. Both Aduhelm and Leqembi have been slow to gain traction in the market. And investors claimed Biogen misled them, although a judge dismissed the case.

Story continues

To assuage its investors, Biogen needs to find ways to improve the uptake of its flagship drugs. The company could focus on identifying patient subsets where the products have clear success rates, showing doctors they can be effective in certain populations — despite concerns. Or, Biogen could find ways to reduce the concerning side effects. Either way, safety and efficacy will be key to adoption.

Biogen’s financial situation is heading in the wrong direction, which is why these new drugs are so critical. Its Q2 2023 earnings showed revenue of $1.8 billion, down from $2.1 billion in Q2 2022. Net income decreased to $593 million from $1 billion in Q2 2022. Biogen has announced it will reduce staff by 11% to cut costs, but that may not be enough to satisfy investors.

Ultimately investors’ worries over the Alzheimer’s drug rollout have had an effect. But if Biogen can regain investors’ confidence, they could regain their crown as a high-potential biotech stock to buy.

Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN), a major player in genetic sequencing and a key biotech stock to watch, has faced a difficult battle with activist investor Carl Icahn. In 2021, Illumina acquired cancer detection company GRAIL in a vertical integration merger. Since GRAIL’s assays used Illumina equipment, this would have strengthened Illumina’s position in the market. However, antitrust regulators opposed the move, and Illumina was ordered to divest from the company in 2023.

Illumina fought a long battle with regulators, which raised the ire of Carl Icahn. Icahn believed the fight with regulators was detrimental to shareholders. He also sought to remove the chief executive officer (CEO) and install his own candidates to the board.

Icahn’s tactics worked, and his candidates were placed on the board while Illumina’s CEO resigned. The interim CEO will stay on until July 31, which puts Illumina at a crossroads. How much Icahn supports the new CEO could be crucial to the company’s long-term investor relations. Likewise, the new company executive could signal future priorities about whether Illumina will continue to seek vertical integration with companies using its products or focus on itself.

No matter what happens, Illumina is still a major player in genetic sequencing. While its Q1 2023 earnings report showed revenue and net income down from a year ago, it still has a huge customer base and room to grow. Whether the company continues to look outward or focus inward, it is still a high-potential biotech stock in the sequencing industry. That makes ILMN a biotech stock any investor should watch.

Exelixis (EXEL) The logo for Exelixis is displayed on a phone.

Exelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL) has been in a clash with Farallon Capital Management (privately held) over its R&D strategy. Farallon has expressed concerns about Exelixis’ oversized research and development (R&D) budget and its pursuit of various drug strategies. The company advocates for a more focused approach, concentrating on a few core competencies. Additionally, Farallon is pushing for a larger share buyback to further enhance shareholder value.

While Farallon is not pushing for overwhelming changes, it is still affecting Exelixis. During the initial skirmish, Farallon succeeded in securing three board seats. Exelixis tried to defend its strategy in the court of public opinion but did not persuade many investors.

Ultimately Exelixis remains at a crossroads, with Farallon demanding cuts and the company pushing for growth. If Exelixis can pull together a string of strong clinical trials or even drug approval, the company could defend its strategy more easily against Farallon. But if investors think revenue cannot meet R&D demands, they’ll be more likely to side with Farallon.

Exelixis’s Q1 2023 earnings report showed net product revenue growth from $310 million to $363 million. However, R&D expenses grew from $157 million to $234 million, decreasing net income from $68.6 million to $40 million. That highlights the turmoil with Farallon. If R&D continues to grow too fast, the company will become unprofitable. Investors should look toward Exelixis’ next earnings report on August 1st to see which direction the company is heading.

Ultimately, Exelixis versus Farallon is the classic battle between growth and profit. But Exelixis has proven to be a resilient biotech stock to watch.

Illumina’s chairman lost his board seat due to shareholder votes and the CEO departed shortly after the vote. The shareholder rancor was due to Illumina’s acquisition of GRAIL rather than the core Illumina business, which Icahn believes is materially undervalued by the market today. We agree.""

2023-07-31T21:25:07+00:00,Diamondback Energy (FANG) Q2 Earnings Lag Estimates,"Diamondback Energy (FANG) came out with quarterly earnings of $3.68 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.92 per share. This compares to earnings of $7.07 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -6.12%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this energy exploration and production company would post earnings of $4.36 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.10, delivering a surprise of -5.96%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.

Diamondback , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, posted revenues of $1.92 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.42%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.77 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

Diamondback shares have added about 6.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 19.3%.

What's Next for Diamondback?

While Diamondback has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Story continues

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Diamondback: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $4.57 on $2.04 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $16.90 on $7.95 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States is currently in the bottom 22% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Another stock from the same industry, Amplify Energy (AMPY), has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023. The results are expected to be released on August 8.

This oil and gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.28 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -61.6%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

Amplify Energy's revenues are expected to be $78.21 million, down 35.8% from the year-ago quarter.

2023-07-31T20:02:00+00:00,"Letter to Stockholders Issued by Diamondback Energy, Inc.","MIDLAND, Texas, July  31, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

Diamondback Stockholders,

This letter is meant to be a supplement to our earnings release and is being furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and released to our stockholders simultaneously with our earnings release. Please see the information regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial information included at the end of this letter.

The second quarter of 2023 was characterized by volume outperformance, reduced operating and administrative expenses, decreased net debt, additional non-core divestitures and another increase to our base dividend. Further, we have line of sight to significant capex reductions through the remainder of the year, which will result in higher expected Free Cash Flow (""FCF"") at current commodity prices. To summarize, we continue to execute across all facets of our business model.

Production:
Diamondback continued to execute and exceed expectations in the second quarter, with both oil and total production above the high end of our second quarter guidance ranges. As a result of this year-to-date outperformance and our continued confidence in the forward outlook, we are increasing our full year oil and total production estimates to the high end of their respective annual ranges. The midpoint of annual daily oil production moves to 261 MBO/d from 259 MBO/d, while the midpoint of annual total daily production moves to 440 MBOE/d from 435 MBOE/d.

Oil production is expected to grow slightly in the second half of the year, with third quarter oil production projected to be 262 – 265 MBO/d (440 – 445 MBOE/d). We anticipate we will continue to grow oil production organically at a low single digit annual pace next year with a similar level of activity to this year. This is primarily a result of the quality of the acreage we are developing on a large scale in the Midland Basin, combined with a high mineral interest across the development plan.

Oil realizations increased quarter over quarter to 97% of West Texas Intermediate (""WTI"") pricing for the quarter. We still expect to realize at least 95% of WTI when WTI is at least $65 per barrel, with some quarters above that number. Gas and NGL realizations declined significantly quarter over quarter commensurate with the respective declines in each commodity.

We continue to protect our downside exposure through a hedge program where we buy deferred premium puts up to 12 months in advance for oil, with a goal of being at least 60% hedged heading into a respective quarter. For gas, we hedge with wide two-way collars and a well-protected basis exposure. To us, this hedging philosophy is an insurance policy that protects against the extreme downside where we protect our dividend, still generate FCF and manage our leverage ratio.

Capital Expenditures: Cash capex for the second quarter was $711 million, in the upper half of our quarterly guidance range. We expect cash capex to decline ~5% in the third quarter to $650 - $700 million as we begin to see the benefits of both lower well costs and lower drilling activity, with a minor benefit from a slower completion cadence. We also expect cash capex to decline further in the fourth quarter, which should set a baseline for our 2024 capital plan. Both raw materials (including steel, diesel and sand) and service costs continue to decline, setting us up for lower completed well costs as we head into 2024.

Our revised full year 2023 cash capex guidance is $2,600 - $2,675 million, which is up just over 1% at the midpoint from our initial guidance. We drilled almost 1.1 million lateral feet in the second quarter, including almost 1 million lateral feet in the Midland Basin. Through the second quarter, we have drilled approximately 56% of our estimated total lateral footage and completed approximately 54% of our estimated total lateral footage for the year. This translates to 180 (53%) out of our estimated 335 - 350 wells drilled and 177 (53%) out of our estimated 330 - 345 wells to be completed for the year, coinciding with our spend year to date of 52% of our capex budget.

We also expect to have higher than previously expected capital spend on midstream projects in 2023, primarily for high-return third-party water business that utilizes our extensive existing recycling and disposal infrastructure in the Midland Basin.

Operating Costs:
Lease operating expenses (“LOE”) were lower than guidance expectations in the second quarter, primarily due to the ability of our field and operations organizations to ""control what they can control"", which is primarily the variable costs that make up LOE. Therefore, we are reducing our LOE guidance by $0.10 per BOE for the year to $4.90 - $5.40 per BOE, implying LOE will still increase from second quarter levels in the second half of the year primarily due to third party produced water disposal obligations.

Cash G&A has trended lower than expectations due to cost control and the increase in production seen this year. Therefore, we feel comfortable reducing our annual guidance by $0.05 per BOE at the midpoint to $0.60 - $0.75 per BOE. Due to continued and expected debt reduction and higher volumes, we also feel comfortable reducing our interest expense guidance per BOE by $0.10 to $1.20 - $1.30 per BOE. Taken together, these reductions to cash operating costs amount to $0.25 per BOE of total savings relative to initial expectations.

As it relates to non-cash costs, we increased our DD&A guidance to $10.00 - $10.75 per BOE due to the impact of higher development and leasehold costs from recent acquisitions. We also reduced our non-cash G&A estimate for the year by $0.05 per BOE to $0.35 - $0.45 per BOE.

Return of Capital:
Our Board continues to believe the primary method to return capital to stockholders needs to be through our base dividend, one that is sustainable and well-protected through the cycles inherent in a cyclical industry. The Board considers the base dividend to be a “debt” owed to our stockholders, and stress-tests that debt to ensure it is protected down to $40 per barrel oil prices. Due to our lower debt burden, lower share count and low reinvestment rate, they have made the decision to raise our base dividend this quarter by 5% to $3.36 annually ($0.84 quarterly). The Board will continue to review our corporate breakeven and fixed obligations as we focus on sustainable base dividend growth in the future.

We generated $1.51 billion of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities and $547 million of FCF in the second quarter, and repurchased 2.43 million shares for $321 million ($132.21 / share average). Therefore, including our increased quarterly base dividend commitment, we exceeded our commitment to return at least 75% of our FCF to stockholders in the second quarter as the market presented consistent opportunities for us to repurchase shares. We are confident in our path towards further debt reduction and we currently see FCF increasing in the second half of the year due to increased commodity prices and lower capex.

Year to date, we have repurchased 5.36 million shares, which is more shares than were issued for our Lario acquisition that closed in January 2023. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2021, we have repurchased 18.2 million shares for $2.2 billion ($122.99 / share average), while also distributing $13.24 per share in base and variable dividends over the same period.

Balance Sheet:
Total debt and net debt decreased to just under $6.7 billion in the second quarter, down from just over $7 billion in the first quarter. We expect net debt to continue to decrease in the third quarter through a combination of FCF generation, proceeds from asset sales closing in the quarter, and the continued reduction of our income tax receivable.

Other Business:
We exceeded our non-core asset sale target of $1.0 billion by year end 2023 this quarter by announcing and closing the sale of our equity interest in the OMOG oil gathering system. Since initiating the non-core asset sale program, we have announced or closed transactions with $1.1 billion of gross proceeds. As a reminder, proceeds from these asset sales will go towards further debt reduction. We are not planning to increase our non-core asset sale target at this time, but still have significant value in our midstream assets and equity method investments that may be monetized at some point in the future.

To summarize, we remain confident in the forward outlook for the business. We continue to develop our best assets in the core of the Permian Basin, are seeing costs come down in real time and should see FCF increase into the second half of the year and 2024 at current commodity prices.

Thank you for your interest in Diamondback Energy,

Travis D. Stice
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer

2023-07-31T20:02:00+00:00,"Viper Energy Partners LP, a Subsidiary of Diamondback Energy, Inc., Announces Intent to Convert Into Corporate Stucture","Viper Energy Partners LP

MIDLAND, Texas, July 31, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Viper Energy Partners LP (NASDAQ:VNOM) (“Viper” or the “Company”), a subsidiary of Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) (“Diamondback”), today announced its intent to convert its legal status from a Delaware limited partnership into a Delaware corporation. The conversion is expected to be completed by or before December 31, 2023. After the conversion, it is expected that Viper’s current limited partners would own the same percentage of the corporation’s outstanding shares as they currently own of Viper’s outstanding equity interests.

In connection with the conversion, Viper intends to adopt a corporate governance structure designed to meet the eligibility requirements for certain indices and benchmarks, although no assurances can be provided regarding inclusion in any such index or benchmark. Because Viper is already treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Viper expects that the conversion of its entity form into a Delaware corporation will not impact the current tax treatment for Viper’s current public common unitholders.

Upon conversion, it is intended that Viper’s common stockholders will have the ability to vote on all matters on which stockholders of a corporation are generally entitled to vote under the Delaware General Corporation Law, including the election of Viper’s board of directors. Immediately following the proposed conversion, Viper would be a “controlled company” under the rules of NASDAQ because Diamondback would own more than 50% of the voting power of Viper’s common stock. In addition, Diamondback intends to continue to provide general and administrative services to Viper post-conversion in substantially the same manner as Diamondback currently provides. At or around the actual conversion, Viper intends to provide additional information regarding the post-conversion structural arrangements, including the terms of Viper’s post-conversion governing documents and the arrangements providing for Diamondback’s provision of services to Viper post-conversion. It is expected that post-conversion, Viper’s publicly traded common stock will be traded on NASDAQ under the existing ticker symbol “VNOM.”

Travis Stice, Chief Executive Officer of Viper’s General Partner, stated, “Today’s announcement of Viper’s intent to convert into a Delaware corporation is an important step in the growth and evolution of Viper. When completed, this conversion will deliver increased corporate governance rights to our current limited partners and is intended to position Viper such that the value of our mineral and royalty assets can be fully recognized.

The July Rate Hike

On July 26, the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates once again, this time by 25 basis points. The 0.25% hike has brought interest rates up to about 5.25% to 5.50%, which is the highest level of interest rates in over 22 years. The decision to hike rates this month was unanimous at the Fed, and it was also signaled that the public can expect to see even further rate hikes up ahead this year. Considering this hike, the investing community continues to be plagued with inflation-related concerns and what the current interest rate levels will mean for businesses and consumers heading into the second half of the year. For many, the jump to such a high level of interest rates is proving to be a source of market uncertainty and turbulence, while others are holding on to the belief that the Fed will manage to bring inflation down to a maximum rate of 2% in the long run, as has been affirmed in the Federal Open Market Committee statement.

In light of this hike, in a CNBC interview on July 26, David Kelly from JPMorgan Asset Management made the following comments on how he views stocks progressing in the market over the next six months and beyond:

""I look at valuations a lot and I do worry about the mega-cap stocks that have really led this charge. But overall I think it good be pretty good because the key point is, eventually inflations gonna get back down to where we were in the last decade, it's gonna get back down to 2%. Eventually, the Fed's gonna have to react to a recession and cut rates back down again and so you get back to a slow growth, low inflation environment in which companies are very good at maintaining margins. I mean that's the other message that we've seen from the earnings reports so far this month. You know, there's a problem with revenues, but they're doing a great job at maintaining margins. I think US companies can do well in a cold climate, and I think the stock market is taking comfort from that.""

Navigating The Market After The Hike

According to Kelly, it is becoming increasingly important to keep an eye on stock valuations heading into the second half of the year to ensure one does not end up with overpriced stocks in the event of a market correction. For him, the choice sectors to keep an eye on include industrials and financials. Overall though, Kelly's opinion seems to be that even in the event of a recession, US companies can be expected to perform well enough to satisfy their shareholders.

Considering the above, it has become abundantly clear that investors today should really consider factors like stock valuations, potential impacts of the recent rate hike, higher prices, and much more when they are making their investments. Another factor that might be worth considering is the performance of companies that are steadily gaining popularity among the younger generations of consumers and investors today. These up-and-coming stocks, such as e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), are now offering products to a new cohort of consumers that are setting them apart from their competitors and increasing consumer engagement. Some may consider them to be some of the best stocks to invest in right now, and many of the names on our list below can be considered to be some of the best growth stocks for the next 10 years even. In light of imminent market uncertainty and recession-related concerns, we have thus compiled the list below to give investors today some more choices that may be beneficial additions to their portfolios.  11 Best Up And Coming Stocks To Invest In

Shares of value-oriented beauty brand ELF received a meaningful boost from normalizing beauty usage and spending in a post-COVID environment, which we believe has contributed to its premium multiple relative to competitors in the beauty space. As this temporary lift unwinds, we expect elf’s valuation to similarly return to a level better aligned with its product offerings.”

Crocs designs, develops, manufactures and distributes casual footwear and accessories for men, women and children. The company invented the molded plastic Clog in 2002 and has turned it into a $3B global revenue base. We believe revenue growth will continue to surprise to the upside driven by expansion opportunities outside the US, demand from new product introductions (including from recently acquired Hey Dude) and a distribution push both within the direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels. Given the company is still small in terms of a global market share (its $4B in revenues puts them at 1% global market share of the footwear industry), we believe there is a long runway for growth and initiated a GardenSM position.”

“We initiated a position in Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN), a global medical device company best known for its “Invisalign” clear aligners, having created the clear aligner category in 1999. Since that time, it has been a disruptor of the traditional use of wire and bracket braces to straighten teeth and treat malocclusions. While it is leader in the clear aligner category with roughly 85-90% market share, the bigger competition is taking share from wire and brackets and on that measure, it only has 10-15% share of the overall teeth straightening market. Over time, through innovation and vertical integration, the company has evolved to be able to treat over 90% of all cases. Further, it has done a great job deepening relationships with orthodontists and general practitioner dentists over time. All in all, we believe this is a business with a durable competitive advantage, operating in a large, growing and very attractive industry, led by a proven and long-term oriented management team, with a very long runway ahead of it to grow and compound at very attractive rates.”

Please refer to these files for more detailed information. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe?

Joseph Hogan: Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our second quarter results and discuss a few highlights from our two operating segments, system services and clear aligners. John will provide more detail on our Q2 financial performance and comment on our views for the third quarter and 2023 overall. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points, and we'll open the call to questions. Overall, I'm pleased to report another better-than-expected quarter with Q2 revenues and operating margins that exceeded our guidance. Q2 results reflect improving trends across regions, strength in teen and younger patient volumes, driven by momentum in both submitters and utilization as well as continued growth from Invisalign First.

In the Teen segment, which represents the largest portion of the 21 million annual orthodontic case starts, 195,000 teens and kids started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners during the second quarter. An increase of 7% sequentially and 10% year-over-year, reflecting the highest annual growth rate in the teen segment since 2021. For Systems & Services, second quarter revenues of $169.5 million were up 10.5% sequentially and down very slightly 1% year-over-year. For Q2, sequential increases in systems and services revenues, reflects increased scanner volumes across the regions and higher services and non-system revenues, reflecting increased sales of certified pre-owned or what we call CPO scanners and higher subscription revenues. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 services revenues increased primarily due to higher subscription revenues from a large number of iTero scanners in the field.

We also had higher non-system scanner revenues related to our certified pre-owned again CPOs and our scanner leasing and rental programs. For Q2, total clear aligner revenues of $832.7 million up 5.4% sequentially and 4.3% year-over-year. Q2 sequential revenue growth rate is consistent with our historical three year average and reflects growth across all regions. Q2 non-case revenues at $80 million were up 6.2% sequentially and 18% year-over-year, reflecting continued growth from Vivera retainers and Invisalign Doctor Subscription Program, or DSP, our monthly subscription-based clear aligner program. And Commerce sales for aligner-related consumables, like aligner cases and whitening and cleaning products. DSP has been successful in addressing an important and growing opportunity for experienced Invisalign doctors.

It is our first subscription-based clear aligner program that enables doctors to reach new patients and provide them with a better overall experience. DSP enables doctors flexibilities to treat simple touch-up cases or offer their patients a superior, flexible, and convenient retention solution. We introduced DSP in the United States and Canada in 2021. We expanded it to Spain and the Nordic countries in Q2 2023, and we'll launch DSP in France and the United Kingdom in the second half of this year. We have also extended DSP to DSO partners who recognize the value of our Invisalign subscription aligner put model. Over the past two years, our DSP subscription program has continued to ramp and in Q2 drove strong volume growth in touch-up cases typically five to 10 stage cases of aligners.

For Q2 '23, we shipped over 18,000 DSP touch-up cases in North America, up from 15,500 in Q1 '23 and more than double the case volume in Q2 '22 last year. Given its continued success and contribution to our growth this year, DSP touch-up cases are included in my overall commentary for clear aligners. Otherwise, specified in my remarks, our case volumes and metrics do not include DSP and touch up cases. For Q2, total clear aligner volumes were up 5% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. Q2 clear aligner volumes, including DSP touch-up cases, were up 5.4% sequentially and up 2.4% year-over-year. For the Americas, Q2 clear aligner volumes reflect sequential growth across the region from both ortho and GP dentist channels, an increase in teen case starts driven by momentum from Invisalign First and increased adult patients from the GP dentist channel.

In North America, adoption of the Invisalign Comprehensive three and three product drove sequential volume growth. For Q2, North American ortho utilization was up sequentially and down a fraction year-over-year, including DSP touch-up cases. Q2 North American ortho utilization was up both sequentially and year-over-year as noted in our Q2 '23 earnings slides. For EMEA, Q2 clear aligner volumes were up sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting growth across the region and continued adoption of Invisalign Moderate, Invisalign Comprehensive three and three products as well as an increase in teen case starts, which grew sequentially and year-over-year driven by Invisalign First and our new Invisalign Teen case packs. On a sequential basis, clear aligner growth was led by Iberia, Italy, DACH, and Turkey.

For APAC, Q2 clear aligner volumes were up sequentially and up year-over-year, reflecting improving trends in China as well as other key markets like Japan, Taiwan, Korea and India. Q2 APAC results also reflect increased Invisalign submitters and higher utilization, especially for teen patients, driven by growth from Invisalign First in the orthodontic channel, which is especially important as we enter the China team season in Q3. Q2 APAC results also reflect growth in the GP channel with increased Invisalign submitters and higher utilization sequentially and year-over-year. During Q2, we continued to roll out the Invisalign Comprehensive three and three product in APAC, where it is now available in Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan, and India. We plan to launch Invisalign three and three in China in Q3.

We are also pleased with the additional adoption of three and three product in APAC, where the majority of cases treated are comprehensive, allowing our doctor customers more flexibility within the Invisalign product portfolio. In June, we hosted 2023 Invisalign APAC Summit in Singapore and brought together nearly a 1,000 orthodontists and general practitioners, dentists and clinic staff from 18 countries across the Asia Pacific region. The Summit showcased Invisalign and iTero products, the Align Digital platform and the recent and upcoming innovations, while also highlighting our doctors' experience with digital transformation, and how it improves the patient treatment journey. Attendees joined expert sessions focused on enhancing treatment planning efficiency, optimizing digital workflows, addressing the unique needs of teens and younger patients in exploring the essential aspect shaping today's digitally driven orthodontic practices.

Teen orthodontic treatment is the largest segment of the orthodontic market worldwide and represents our largest opportunity for clear aligner sales to Orthos. We continue to focus on gaining share from traditional metal braces through teen-specific sales and marketing programs and product features unique to the Invisalign system. For Q2, total clear aligner cases for teenagers were up 7% sequentially and 9.7% year-over-year, reflecting improving trends across the regions. On a sequential basis, growth was driven by increased submitters in the APAC and EMEA regions on a year-over-year basis. TNK starts were in the APAC region, driven by increased submitters and in the EMEA region, driven by increased submitters and utilization, both in the orthodontic channel.

Last year, we introduced the Teen Case Packs in the United States and Canada, and in Q1, Q2, we launched them in France, Scandinavia and Iberia. For the quarter, Teen Case Packs increased sequentially and year-over-year, driven by strength in EMEA. Invisalign First also was up sequentially and year-over-year across all regions and continues to drive adoption of Invisalign treatment among young patients. Invisalign First aligners are designed for Phase 1 treatment, typically in growing children six to 10 years old, making up about 20% of orthodontic case starts. For the dental service organizations, or DSO customers, Q2 clear aligner volumes increased sequentially primarily from the Americas region. Overall, clear aligner growth rate from DSO doctors continues to outpace non-DSO doctors and our DST touch-up cases are ramping nicely up as DSO doctors understand the value of the subscription program brings regarding pricing and flexibility for their patients.

Invisalign is one of the most trusted brands in the orthodontic industry globally among both doctors and patients. On the consumer marketing front, we delivered $10.3 billion impressions and had 30.9 million visits to our website in Q2 '23. To increase awareness and educate young adults, parents teams about the benefits of Invisalign brand, we continue to invest in top media platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, Instagram across all markets as well as key social media influencers and brand ambassadors. In the Americas, we focused on reaching young adults as well as teens and their parents through our influencer and creator-centric campaigns partnering with leading smile squad creators, including Marshall Martin, Rally Shaw, and Jeremy Lin.

Each of these creators shared their personal experiences with Invisalign treatment and why they chose to transform their smile with Invisalign aligners. Additionally, in the United States, we work closely with athletes over time, a high school sports social media platform that showcases the benefits of Invisalign treatment. Brand interest remained strong throughout the quarter with 9.2 million consumers visiting our websites in the Americas region, representing 17% growth year-on-year. In EMEA region, we partnered with new influencers to reach consumers across social media platforms, including TikTok and Meta. In Germany, we launched new testimonial campaigns highlighting the stories of 70 young adults and teens who share why they chose Invisalign treatment and how it impacted their lives.

Our consumer campaigns delivered more than 1.7 billion media impressions and 9.7 million visitors to our website. We continue to invest in consumer advertising across the APAC region, resulting in more than 12 million visitors to our websites and over $4.8 billion impression. We expanded our region in Japan and India via TikTok, Meta and YouTube. We partner with key influencers like [indiscernible]. We saw increased brand interest in consumers as evidenced by 270% year-over-year increase in unique visitors to our website in India and a 46% year-over-year increase in Japan. Adoption of My Invisalign consumer and patient apps continued to increase with 3.1 million downloads to date and over 350,000 monthly active users, a 28% year-over-year growth.

Uses of other digital tools also continue to increase. ClinCheck live update was used by 40,000 doctors on more than 580,000 cases, reducing time spent and modifying treatment by 20%. Invisalign practice app is increasing in adoption with 88,000 doctors who are actively using this app and 5.1 million photos were uploaded in Q2 via the Invisalign practice set. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.

John Morici: Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q2 financial results. Total revenues for the second quarter were $1.002 billion up 6.3% from the prior quarter and up 3.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Q2 '23 revenues were impacted by favorable foreign exchange of approximately $1.3 million or approximately 0.1% sequentially. And unfavorably impacted by approximately $19.4 million year-over-year or approximately 1.9%. Clear aligners Q2 revenues of $832.7 million were up 5.4% sequentially, primarily from higher volumes, higher non-case revenues and higher ASPs. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 clear aligner revenues were up 4.3%, primarily due to higher ASPs, higher non-case revenues and higher volumes.

For Q2, Invisalign ASPs for comprehensive treatment were down sequentially and up year-over-year. On a sequential basis, ASPs reflect larger discounts and product mix shift to lower-priced products partially offset by price increases. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in comprehensive ASPs reflect price increases and higher additional aligners, partially offset by product mix shift, larger discounts and unfavorable foreign exchange. For Q2, Invisalign ASPs for non-comprehensive treatment were up sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the increase in ASPs reflect lower discounts, higher additional aligners, price increases, and favorable foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in non-comprehensive ASPs reflect price increases and higher additional Aligners, partially offset by product mix shift, larger discounts and unfavorable foreign exchange.

In Q1 '23, we launched Invisalign Comprehensive three and three products in most markets, and we have continued to expand into more markets, as previously mentioned. The three and three configuration offers our doctor customers, our Invisalign comprehensive treatment with three additional aligners included within three years of the treatment end date, instead of unlimited additional aligners with five years of the treatment end date at the 2022 Invisalign comprehensive product price. Over time, we have come to learn that on average, Invisalign doctors complete a comprehensive Invisalign treatment with two or fewer additional aligners. We are pleased with the continued adoption of the Invisalign Comprehensive three and three product and anticipate that it will continue to grow, providing doctors the flexibility they desire and allowing us to recognize more revenue upfront with deferred revenue being recognized over a shorter period of time, compared to our traditional Invisalign comprehensive product.

As revenues from subscriptions, retainers, and ancillary products continue to grow globally, some of the historical metrics that only focus on case shipments are expected to account for a lesser percentage of our overall growth. In our earnings release and financial slides, you will see that we have added our total clear aligner revenue per case shipment, which we believe to be more indicative measure of our overall growth strategy. Q2 '23 clear aligner revenues impacted from favorable foreign exchange of approximately $1.2 million or approximately 0.1% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, clear aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $16.3 million or approximately 1.9%. Clear aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $13 million or up 1% sequentially and $138.6 million or up 12.2% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped.

Q2 '23 systems and services revenue of $169.5 million were up 10.5% sequentially, mostly due to higher scanner volume, higher revenues from our certified preowned program and higher services revenue from our larger base of scanners sold, partially offset by unfavorable ASPs. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 '23 systems and services revenue were down 1%, primarily due to lower scanner volume and unfavorable ASPs, partially offset by higher services revenues from our larger base of scanners sold and higher revenues from our CPO and leasing rental programs. Q2 '23 systems and services revenue were impacted from favorable foreign exchange of approximately $0.1 million or approximately 0.1% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, systems and services revenue were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $3.1 million or approximately 1.8%.

Systems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was down $2.3 million or 0.8% sequentially, primarily due to the decrease in the deferral of service revenues included with our scanner purchase and up $8.6 million or 3.3% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales, and the deferral of service revenues included with our scanner purchase, which will be recognized ratably over the service period. As our scanner portfolio expands, and we introduced new products, we increased the opportunities for customers to upgrade, make trade-ins, and provide refurbished scanners for certain markets. As such, our model is changing. We expect to continue growing our programs and as offering our CPO units for purchase and selling the way the customer -- our customers desire.

Developing new capital equipment opportunities to meet the digital transformation needs of our customers and DSO partners, is a natural progression for our equipment business with a large and growing base of scanner sold. Moving on to gross margin. Second quarter overall gross margin was 71.2%, up 1.2 points sequentially and up 0.3 points year-over-year. Overall gross margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately 0.5 points on a year-over-year basis. Clear aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 72.4%, up 0.7 points sequentially, primarily due to the lower mix of additional aligners, favorable manufacturing variances and higher ASPs. Clear aligner gross margin for the second quarter was down 0.9 points year-over-year, primarily due to increased manufacturing spend as we continue to ramp up operations at our new manufacturing facility in Poland and a higher mix of additional aligner volume, partially offset by higher ASPs and lower freight.

Systems and Services gross margin for the second quarter was 65.1%, up 3.5 points sequentially, primarily from lower service and freight costs, partially offset by lower ASPs. Systems and Services gross margin for the second quarter was up 5.3 points year-over-year, primarily from lower service and freight costs and higher services revenue, partially offset by lower ASPs. Q2 operating expenses were $541.7 million, up sequentially 2.8% and up 8.5% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up $14.5 million, primarily from higher consumer marketing spend and higher incentive compensation. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $42.3 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and our continued investments in sales and R&D activities, partially offset by controlled spending on advertising and marketing as part of our efforts to proactively manage costs.

On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation, and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, partially offset by restructuring and other charges, operating expenses were $505 million up 2.9% sequentially and up 8.4% year-over-year. Our second quarter operating income of $171.9 million resulted in an operating margin of 17.2% up 3 points sequentially and down 2.2 points year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating margin is primarily attributed to higher gross margin, as well as favorable impact from foreign exchange of 0.1 points. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily attributed to investments in our go-to-market teams and technology, as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 1.1 points.

On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions, offset by restructuring other charges, operating margin for the second quarter was 21.3%, and up 2.8 points sequentially and down 2 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense net for the second quarter was a loss of $0.3 million compared to an income of $1.1 million in the first quarter and a loss of $14.6 million in the second quarter a year ago, primarily due to foreign exchange. The GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 34.8%, consistent with the first quarter effective tax rate of 34.8% and 35% in the second quarter of the prior year. As a reminder, in Q4 2022, we changed our methodology for the computation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate to a long-term projected tax rate and have given effect to the new methodology from January 1, 2022, and recast previously reported quarterly results in 2022.

Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the second quarter was 20%, reflecting the change in our methodology. Second quarter net income per diluted share was $1.46, up sequentially $0.32 and up $0.02 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.02 on a sequential basis and unfavorably impacted by $0.15 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.22 for the second quarter, up $0.40 sequentially and up $0.07 year-over-year. Note that the prior year 2022 non-GAAP net income per diluted share in our prior year 2022 non-GAAP reflects the Q4 2022 change in our methodology for the computation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and short-term, and long-term marketable securities were $133.8 billion up sequentially $112.4 million and up $56.6 million year-over-year.

Of our $133.8 billion balance $314.3 million was held in the U.S. and $719.5 million was held by our international entities. In Q2, we completed a $75 million equity investment in Heartland Dental a multi-disciplinary DSO with GP and ortho practices across the U.S. During Q1 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program to succeed the 2021 $1 billion program. Currently, $1 billion remains available for repurchase under the 2023 $1 billion stock repurchase program. Q2 accounts receivable balance was $908.4 million, up sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 81 days, down approximately two days sequentially and down approximately four days as compared to Q2 last year. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $251.9 million.

Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $58.5 million, primarily related to our continued investments to increase aligner manufacturing capacity in facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures amounted to $193.3 million. Now turning to our outlook. As Joe mentioned earlier, we are pleased with our Q2 results. While the macroeconomic environment still remains uncertain, we have seen improvements in the operating environment and the consumer demand signals that influence our outlook. For Q3 2023, we anticipate our worldwide revenue to be in the range of $990 million to $1.01 billion, up approximately 12% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect our Q3 2023 GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly up from Q2 2023 as we continue to strategically prioritize our investments in R&D and go-to-market activities to drive growth.

For full-year 2023, assuming no circumstances occur that are beyond our control, we anticipate our 2023 worldwide revenue to be in the range of $3.97 billion to $3.99 billion, up approximately 7% year-over-year at the midpoint. We also expect our full-year 2023 GAAP operating margin to be slightly above 17% and our 2023 non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above 21%, a 1 point improvement from the guidance we provided in April of 2023. For 2023, we expect investments in capital expenditures to be approximately $200 million. Capital expenditures are expected to primarily relate to building construction improvements as well as manufacturing capacity in support of our continued international expansion. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments.

Joe?

Joseph Hogan: At our continued growth despite the economic slowdown in uncertain environment. Q2 results demonstrate our resilience and adaptability.

2023-07-27T11:00:16+00:00,"With 73% ownership, Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) boasts of strong institutional backing","Key Insights

Institutions' substantial holdings in Datadog implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price 48% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Insiders have sold recently

Every investor in Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 73% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).

Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.

Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Datadog.

View our latest analysis for Datadog  ownership-breakdown

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Datadog?

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Datadog. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Datadog, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. earnings-and-revenue-growth

Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Datadog. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 7.7% of shares outstanding. With 4.7% and 3.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and RTP Ventures are the second and third largest shareholders. Additionally, the company's CEO Olivier Pomel directly holds 2.7% of the total shares outstanding.

Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.

Insider Ownership Of Datadog

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Datadog, Inc.. Insiders own US$2.7b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public-- including retail investors -- own 19% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

2023-07-26T01:34:41+00:00,"If You Can Only Buy One Tech Stock, It Better Be One of These 7 Names","Remember The Game of Thrones? If I had to describe investing in stocks in only four words, it would be “The Game of Trends.”  That’s because, by first identifying strong trends and then the companies that will benefit from them, it’s possible to select firms that are very well-positioned to succeed going forward. But of course, it’s also important to make sure that these companies’ individual businesses are indeed trending in the right direction. Using those two criteria, both of which involve trends, investors can find the best tech stocks to buy. The only other important “rule of thumb” is to ensure that you aren’t buying overvalued stocks. With all that in mind, let’s play “the game of trends”  and identify the seven best tech stocks to buy now.

Best Tech Stocks: Xpeng (XPEV) man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% Upside

Source: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.com

One trend that favors China-based electric vehicle maker Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) is the fact that the Asian nation’s government looks poised to unleash economic stimulus. Specifically, the country’s Politburo, a key group of leaders within the ruling Communist Party, stated that it would take measures to incentivize consumers to spend more money.

In the past, many such stimulus packages unveiled by Beijing have included subsidies for EVs. so Xpeng could very well directly benefit from the nation’s coming incentives. Showing that the Street expects XPEV stock to get a big lift from the package, the shares were surging 11% on the afternoon of July 24.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Another trend that favors Xpeng is the fact that its new G6 SUV, which costs less than Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) roughly equivalent Model Y, appears to be very popular in China. Providing evidence for that assertion is the fact that, three days after the company began taking pre-orders for the EV, it had already received more than 25,000 reservations. Finally, as I’ve pointed out in the past, Xpeng is a world leader when it comes to autonomous driving.

Best Tech Stocks: iCAD (ICAD) An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""

Source: PX Media / Shutterstock

iCAD (NASDAQ:ICAD), whose superior breast cancer screening tools utilize AI, is benefiting from rising awareness of the power of artificial intelligence and from its strong, new leadership. Providing evidence for those assertions,  iCAD announced a deal with Radiology Partners. According to iCAD, Radiology Partners, “the nation’s largest radiology practice,” will use iCAD’s “breast AI technologies.”

I believe that, given Radiology Partners’ large size, the agreement is a game changer for iCAD. Further, the deal justifies my prior faith in iCAD’s new CEO, Dana Brown who has a very impressive resume and, in my view, will deliver much more good news for the company and its shareholders in the medium term. The $85 million market capitalization of ICAD stock far undervalues the company’s potential and outlook.

Best Tech Stocks: Symbotic (SYM) Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker cryptos

In a previous column, I noted that according to Seeking Alpha columnist Arban Shahzeb, Symbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) markets “AI-powered robots” and “AI-enabled data platforms” (that) allow warehouse operators to cut costs, transport their products more quickly, and attain nearly flawless ‘accuracy.’”

I stated that Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Albertsons (NYSE:ACI) had purchased Symbotic’s products, “validating its offerings.” Indicating that my faith in the company was justified, SoftBank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY) launched a $100 million joint venture with Symbotic. Among the trends from which Symbotic is benefiting is increased respect for the power of AI and robotics. Additionally, I continue to believe that, in the second half of this year, consumers’ demand for goods will rebound and start to normalize, providing  SYM stock with another positive catalyst.

In the wake of the agreement with Softbank, the stock’s market capitalization of $22.75 billion far undervalues the company’s long-term outlook.

Baidu (BIDU) A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.

Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) also has multiple, strong, positive catalysts. Like Xpeng, Baidu should get a significant boost from the stimulus measures that Beijing plans to introduce. Additionally, the same rebound in consumers’ demand for goods that I expect to occur in the U.S. should eventually happen in China as well, boosting BIDU’s ad revenue from firms that specialize in selling products to consumers.

Moreover, BIDU should get a major lift from the increased demand for AI. Indeed, Goldman Sachs on July 17 placed BIDU on its Regional Conviction Buy list, citing the company’s ability to benefit from Generative AI. According to the bank, BIDU has an “expanding AI product suite” that’s powered by “four layers of generative AI service offerings.”

Further, Goldman expected the tech company to get a lift from increased ad spending by small and medium businesses that don’t have access to the Internet. The bank placed a $193 price target on the name, well above the $149 level at which the shares were trading on the afternoon of July 25. Finally, as I’ve pointed out in past columns, BIDU, like Xpeng, is a leader in the autonomous-driving race.

As I noted in a past column, Super Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI) “markets servers that are very well-suited for creating AI. One of its servers, for example, ‘supports up to 10 next-gen accelerators.’ AI is produced using accelerators.”

On July 20, my confidence in SMCI (whose shares I own) was rewarded. That’s because the company reported preliminary net sales for its fiscal fourth quarter of $2.16 billion to $2.18 billion, well above its previous outlook of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. What’s more, SMCI hiked its Q4 earnings per share guidance, excluding certain items, to $3.35 to $3.45 versus just $2.13 to $2.65 previously. Clearly, SMCI’s business is exploding as the AI phenomenon continues to accelerate.

SMCI has a Composite Rating of 98 out of 99 from Investor’s Business Daily, and the publication gives it an Accumulation/Distribution Grade of A, indicating that institutional investors have been buying a great deal of the shares over the last 13 weeks. Although the shares have more than tripled this year, their forward price-earnings ratio is an attractive 26.

Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) should benefit from the increased utilization of AI, which should increase the utilization of its offering, according to Investor’s Business Daily. Additionally, on July 25, research firm Wolfe Research raised its rating on the shares to “outperform” from “peer perform.”

In fact, according to the firm, DDOG is starting to experience less competition, while the positive catalyst that it will receive from AI could make it “the fastest growing software company,” Seeking Alpha reported. Wolfe also believes DDOG’s second-quarter results can significantly exceed analysts’ average estimates. Also, the DDOG stock has a very high forward price-earnings ratio of 96. But analysts, on average, expect the company’s earnings per share to jump to $1.54 in 2024 from just 98 cents last year. Given that tremendous growth, the name’s valuation is attractive.

HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) is a leader in automating “marketing and sales functions.” Its main offering ” also assists clients in social media, search engine optimization, and website content management.” By incorporating AI into its current offerings, HUBS should be able to greatly improve them, making them much more helpful to companies and causing the already very rapid growth of its top and bottom lines to accelerate meaningfully.

HUBS last reported its quarterly results on May 3. During the quarter, its top line surged 27% year-over-year, while its EPS, excluding certain items, soared more than 100% year over year to $1.20. In addition, the company’s gross margin came in at a very impressive 83.6%. Helping, Barclays expects the company to benefit from the improved health of America’s small and medium businesses. Analysts, on average, predict that the company’s EPS will jump to $6.07 next year from just $2.08 in 2022. given that rapid growth, the stock is attractive despite its very high forward price-earnings ratio of 120.

2023-07-31T13:48:00+00:00,Factors to Note Ahead of ANSYS (ANSS) Q2 Earnings Release,"ANSYS, Inc ANSS is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 2.

Factors to Note

Higher adoption of ANSYS’ simulation solutions in various verticals, like automotive and ground transportation, aerospace & defense and high tech, is likely to have favored the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.

The company is likely to have benefited from rapid growth in the high-tech industry, led by ongoing development in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Increased demand for high-performance computing and 5G wireless systems in the semiconductor space also bodes well.

Continued momentum in subscription lease licenses is likely to have aided the second-quarter revenue performance, owing to customers shifting from perpetual licenses to subscription leases.

Strong channel distribution, go-to-market momentum and a healthy pipeline are expected to have contributed to the annual contract value.

On the flip side, geopolitical instability, forex volatility and weakness in global macroeconomic conditions are likely to have weighed on the company’s performance as clients cut back on expenditure.

Recent Developments

In June, ANSYS expanded the capabilities of its Ansys Discovery platform by incorporating high-frequency electromagnetics modeling for antennas. This development allows engineering teams to conduct virtual exploration of multiple design areas simultaneously, minimizing the need for costly physical prototyping and testing.

Story continues

In May, the company announced the acquisition of Diakopto, a provider of Electronic Design Automation solutions for integrated circuit development. The acquisition is expected to enable design engineers to ""shift left,"" detecting interconnect parasitic problems early in the design cycle and minimizing costly iterations in the design cycle.

What Our Model Says

Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for ANSYS this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. However, this is not the case here.

2023-07-31T11:30:31+00:00,The 3 Best 3D Printing Stocks to Buy Now: July 2023,"2022 was unkind to growth stocks of all stripes, but the sell-off in the top 3D printing stocks started much earlier. After a strong run-up off the pandemic lows, the 3D Printing ETF (CBOE:PRNT), an equal-weighted index of approximately 50 companies involved in the 3D printing industry, topped out in early 2021 at around $50. Today, it trades for less than half that.

While the ETF is up nearly 19% so far in 2023, slightly outperforming the S&P 500, the performance of individual 3D printing stocks has been mixed. Case in point: Two of today’s 3D printing stocks to buy are up around 40% year to date while one is down about that much.

As an industry, 3D printing is still in the early innings. According to Grand View Research, the market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.3% through 2030.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

As investors look for ways to play burgeoning technologies, money should continue to flow into the top 3D printing stocks. Below are three ways to get in on the action.

Israel-based Nano Dimension (NASDAQ:NNDM) manufactures additive electronics, including the DragonFly IV 3D printer. The volatile penny stock is up 40% on a year-to-date basis following a massive rally over the past few weeks.

The move higher was fueled by the company’s latest quarterly results. For Q1, Nano reported record revenue of $14.97 million, up 24% year over year and 43% from the previous quarter. Further, the company posted a $22 million profit compared with a loss of $33 million in the year-ago quarter.

While Nano’s fundamentals and growth potential are solid, the firm is embroiled in a legal battle with Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) regarding a potential hostile takeover bid. If you can stomach any additional volatility that may cause, NNDM deserves a place among the best 3D printing stocks for investment.

FARO Technologies (NASDAQ:FARO) is the underperformer on today’s list of 3D printing stocks to buy. Shares are down 45% so far this year. This includes a sharp sell-off following the release of the company’s first-quarter results in early May.

While sales rose 11% year over year to $85 million, the company reported a much larger-than-expected net loss of $7.1 million compared with a $2.5 million loss in the same quarter one year ago. The company noted that cost increases hurt its gross margin, which fell to 46.7% from 53.5% in the year-ago period.

With inflation abating, FARO should be able to get a handle on its costs. And with the stock trading near a five-year low, investors have a chance to pick up shares at a discount. FARO currently trades at just 0.8 times sales, well below its 10-year median of 2.3.

FARO Technologies has been in business since 1981 and isn’t at risk in any palpable sense. Once it can show that product costs have normalized, the stock could make a quick run higher as it starts to play catch-up with its peers.

Ansys (ANSS)  The logo for Anasys (ANSS) displayed on a laptop screen.

Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS) provides engineering simulation and 3D design software. It is the highest-priced name on today’s list of 3D printing stocks to buy, trading at around $340 per share. It is also the most stable of today’s picks, routinely producing earnings for shareholders.

Ansys’ first-quarter earnings, reported on May 3, were particularly impressive. Revenue jumped 20% from a year ago to $509.4 million. Meanwhile, net income increased by 42% year over year to $100.6 million as the company’s profit margin improve substantially. The strong results gave management the confidence to raise full-year revenue and profit guidance.

The firm is scheduled to release Q2 earnings on Aug. 2. Given that it has beaten analysts’ consensus earnings estimate in each of the past four quarters, another positive surprise may be in store this week. A beat could cause a pop in shares. But if we instead see a post-earnings pullback, investors may want to buy the dip in this top 3D printing stock.

2023-07-31T17:22:10+00:00,25 Richest Women in the World,"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 25 richest women in the world. To skip our detailed analysis of the trends and dynamics of women's businesses, head directly to see the 5 Richest Women in the World.

Women’s Wealth

A lot of the richest people in the world have had to lose their wealth in 2022. According to Forbes World’s Richest List 2023, the total number of billionaires dropped from 2,668 in 2022 to 2,640 in 2023. Overall, the world’s billionaires have lost $500 billion of net worth from $12.7 trillion in March 2022 to $12.2 trillion in March 2023. An interesting fact to note is that the number of female billionaires is on the rise. Among the top richest people in the world, there are 337 women billionaires, up from 327 in 2022.

Women have started to step up and take the initiative of starting their businesses. As we mentioned earlier, almost half of all women-owned businesses are from three sectors that include healthcare and social assistance, beauty and pet care, and scientific and technical services. Women-owned businesses in the U.S. have performed significantly well. First Round Capital claims that the companies it invested in with female founders outperformed all-male founding companies by 63%. Additionally, as we discussed previously, Kauffman Fellows found women-led teams produced 35% better return on investment compared to all-male teams.

Women Kept Under Shadows for Years

Women have faced gender discrimination for centuries in politics, in the workplace, and at home. In some countries, women are legally restricted to work in certain professions while in other economies, they are discriminated against by pay gaps. These are a few problems that have kept women under the shadow for many years. Developed economies have made major changes in their laws and frameworks to implement gender equality across all phases of life.

Feminists have been vocal about the interests of women in all fields of life. According to Pacific University, in 1848 the first wave of modern feminism took place at the Seneca Falls Convention. Elizabeth Cady Stanton introduced and drafted the Seneca Falls Declaration highlighting the ideology and political aspects of the movement. The second movement in the 1960s focused on social equality with equal rights regardless of sex. The movement continued once again in the 1990s, proving the point that women can play an equal and as important role as men.

Technology Paving Ways for Women

One of the major things that have played a big role in women’s equality is technology. Modern technology has created awareness across the globe and women have explored their potential in the best way possible. For instance, women entrepreneurs have made the best use of e-commerce. The e-commerce marketplace has allowed women to capitalize in one of the largest markets in the world.

The biggest e-commerce company, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), has around 9.7 million sellers worldwide, and 1.9 million are active on the platform. On June 19, SellerApp shared the Amazon.com seller statistics showing that women account for 33% of the retailer's sellers, which is a sublime development for women entrepreneurs.

Companies Led by Female CEOs

We have entered a new era as more than 10% of women now lead Fortune 500 companies. The Fortune 500 ranks the largest U.S. public companies by revenue. These companies accumulate around $18 trillion in revenue, representing more than two-thirds of the U.S. GDP. For many decades, the big companies were dominated by male executives. Now we have 53 female CEOs leading Fortune 500 companies, which enlightens gender diversity in executive leadership to another level. Women now have a more important role to play as executives, making massive decisions at the top level.

Some of the Fortune 500 companies which are led by female CEOs include Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), CVS Health Corp. (NYSE:CVS), General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM), Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and Elevance Health Inc. (NYSE:ELV). These five Fortune 500 companies are led by CEOs Lisa Su, Karen Lynch, Mary Barra, Rosalind Brewer, and Gail Koziara Boudreaux, respectively. The female CEOs are putting in a great effort to take these companies to new heights. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the largest companies on the Fortune 500 list. On June 14, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) unveiled its next-generation chip called MI-300 at its product reveal event, which is being considered a potential alternative to NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s AI chips. The company is using AI to be its next big tool for GPUs, CPUs, and adaptive computing solutions. The CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Lisa Su, during the launch event, highlighted AI as ""AMD's largest and most strategic long term growth opportunity."" Shortly after the event, Lisa Su, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss the development of their new AI chip, M1-300. AMD has entered into a new phase of chipmaking with the announcement of its newest generation chip. Su added that everyone is talking about Chatgpt and large language models, and MI-300 is designed for these use cases. Here are some of the comments from Su:

""AI is the defining megatrend for the technology right now. Like, everybody is talking about AI, we have been working on this roadmap for many many years. MI-300 is our newest generation chip and frankly, it’s incredible and I mean, the amount of technology we have on this, a 153 billion transistors. Our customers are super excited about this and we are working closely with them. We will sample in the third quarter and will be in production by the end of the year.

What we see is there is a tremendous demand for GPUs in AI space, for both training and inference. We work with all of the largest cloud manufacturers and many of the largest enterprise guys. So, the key is to get these products to market as fast as possible. It is an incredible time for technology. AI has kinda changed the way we perceive what we’re doing in every industry and every market for all of our productivity and business applications.

We have developed a really comprehensive software capability that is optimized for hardware. We call that the ROCm ecosystem, but on top of that we’ve all these folks in the market that are really developing these frameworks, and the purpose of these frameworks is actually to make it fairly easy and transparent to move different hardware ecosystems.""

According to Su, the total addressable market for AI GPUs is around $30 billion right now and it is going to grow more than 50% each year over the next three to four years. ""We see like $150 billion by the time we get to 2027,"" added Su. 25 Richest Women in the World

2023-07-30T12:28:38+00:00,Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Has Affirmed Its Dividend Of $0.48,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:WBA) investors are due to receive a payment of $0.48 per share on 12th of September. This means the annual payment is 6.4% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry.

Check out our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots Alliance

Walgreens Boots Alliance's Dividend Is Well Covered By Earnings

Impressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Despite not generating a profit, Walgreens Boots Alliance is still paying a dividend. Along with this, it is also not generating free cash flows, which raises concerns about the sustainability of the dividend.

According to analysts, EPS should be several times higher next year. If the dividend extends its recent trend, estimates say the dividend could reach 21%, which we would be comfortable to see continuing. historic-dividend

Walgreens Boots Alliance Has A Solid Track Record

The company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.10, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.92. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5.7% a year over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.

The Dividend Has Limited Growth Potential

Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Earnings per share has been sinking by 28% over the last five years. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this becomes a long term trend.

The Dividend Could Prove To Be Unreliable

Overall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. Although they have been consistent in the past, we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. We don't think Walgreens Boots Alliance is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.

Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. As an example, we've identified 1 warning sign for Walgreens Boots Alliance that you should be aware of before investing. Is Walgreens Boots Alliance not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

2023-07-31T18:55:29+00:00,eBay Turns To AI On Its Attempt Of Tech-Led Business Reimagination,"Despite its earnings beat, eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY) shares tanked 10.5% upon the release of second quarter results last week while its main competitor and e-commerce giant, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) is scheduled to report its earnings on Thursday after the close. As eBay continues its tech-led business reimagination journey, the latest report failed to ease concerns that it is losing its share to Amazon and Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) who are fiercely battling for the U.S. e-commerce throne.

Second Quarter Highlights

For the fiscal second quarter that ended on June 30th, eBay's revenue expanded 5% YoY to $2.54 billion, but gross merchandise value (GMV) contracted 2% to $18.2 billion. While international ebay GMV grew 1%, US eBay GMV contracted 4%. CEO Jamie Iannone revealed the e-commerce platformed an important milestone as advertising revenue reached 2% penetration of GMV. Iannone also added that as of this quarter, a new way of ranking ads on search has been introduced, with this AI-gained capability optimizing cost per acquisition placements for both conversion and ad rate. CFO Stephen Priest noted this is an improvement from first quarter’s 3% drop but eBay lost 1 million active buyers quarter over quarter, as they now total 132 million. Total ads grew 35%, while first-party ad revenue grew roughly 50 points faster than GMV. Non-GAAP earnings amounted to $1.03 per share.

Third Quarter Guidance Below Expectations

Non-GAAP earnings per share have been guided to be between 96 cents and $1.01, while Wall Street analysts expected $1.02. Revenue is expected in the range between $2.46 and $2.52 billion.

AI-Powered Magical Listing

With the help of generated AI, sellers will be able to list their inventory in a far more easier way as eBAy integrated Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)’s creation, Azure’s open AI API, into its core listing flow. Early feedback has been positive with 80% customer satisfaction, among the highest CSAT for any new feature that eBay launched. Iannone pointed out that eBay just got started with this feature as the next step will involve leveraging improved image recognition capabilities to provide flows with the option of a more seamless camera-based listing.

The Bottom Line Is That eBay Is Struggling

Despite its strategic initiatives, such as launching the authenticity guarantee for streetwear in June, the market’s reaction shows concern and weakening momentum among active buyers that eBay is struggling. Unlike Amazon, it only relies on e-commerce and the competition is intense.

eBay will need to do more than simplify listings for sellers, sell more luxury items that boost revenue and refurbished items that attract price-conscious consumers to be able to stay in the e-commerce game. Here’s to hoping that AI support is all that it takes for eBay to stay relevant in the competitive universe, one in which Amazon and Walmart are locked in the battle for the U.S. territory for more than a decade.

2023-07-28T18:39:47+00:00,Billionaire Jeff Vinik’s Stock Picks and 10-Year Performance,"In this piece, we will take a look at billionaire Jeff Vinik's stock picks and 10-year performance. If you want to skip our introduction to the investor, his background, and how some investments have performed over the year, then head on over to Billionaire Jeff Vinik's Top 5 Stocks.

Jeff Vinik has a short history in the hedge fund industry. He set up his fund first in the 90s and then shut it down later after making remarkable returns. Then, he tried setting up his fund again but shut it down in less than a year after citing difficulties in raising capital. A graduate of Harvard University, he is known primarily for running one of the biggest mutual funds in the U.S. and then starting his own hedge fund called Vinik Asset Management.

Both of these earned him his fair share of fame in the finance industry. Under Mr. Vinik's management, the Fidelity Magellan Fund earned quite a bit of controversy as he was criticized for moving the fund's money away from attractive technology stocks into bonds. This was the time when semiconductor stocks (which are all the buzz these days) were in their early phases of their stock market presence. This was also the time when investing in mutual funds - especially by folks who were using their personal savings  - was peaking, as 3 million Americans had piled $3 trillion into the industry.

At Magellan, Mr. Vinik created quite a bit of controversy when it came to light that he had sold large portions of the fund's holdings in semiconductor stocks at a time when the shares were peaking. The semiconductor sector is well known for its cycles of ups and downs, with the latest one undergoing right now as chip makers wait while chip designers' product inventory is digested in the retail chain. Back in the early 1990s, Taiwan and South Korea were rising in stature in the chip world (these two now have some of the most important chip companies in the world). The start of the decade was marked by a strong performance from the Asian firms, but America, which was still a global chip manufacturing base back then, was struggling from an economic contraction in the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, high inflation, and high interest rates (the economy is also experiencing somewhat similar conditions over the past year or so).

Story continues

This crunch created the perfect conditions for a boom in 1995 and the subsequent slowdown which was also reflected in the stock market. Just as all this was happening, Mr. Vinik had written to investors of the Magellan Fund that chip firms, such as Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) were solid investments. This was in a letter that was mailed in November as part of the fund's semiannual report. However, controversy surfaced when the Washington Post reported that Mr. Vinik had actually started selling Micron shares in October and before investors received the letter. This selloff was part of a broader exit from the technology sector with other stocks also being sold. Less than a year after his decision, he would quit Magellan and set up his own hedge fund, with some speculating that the increased scrutiny from 1995 contributed to him leaving Fidelity.

Vinik Asset Management would go on to make a big impact in the hedge fund industry right off the bat. In the first year, the hedge fund's return would sit at a whopping 93.8% and then go on to an average of 48% for five years. After this burst of performance, Mr. Vinik would return $4.2 billion to investors and close the fund to outside investment in 2000. He would, however, try to open up his hedge fund twice again, first in 2005 and then in 2019. The first run would be quite successful as Vinik Asset Management would go on to operate for nearly eight years before a downturn in gold stocks and other factors would make it return capital. The second run was short lived, with Mr. Vinik explaining that it had become difficult to raise capital.

So, today we'll take a look at how his long term investments would have performed ten years after Vinik Asset's final serious foray into the stock market. Some firms that would have performed well are eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR).

The July Rate Hike

On July 26, the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates once again, this time by 25 basis points. The 0.25% hike has brought interest rates up to about 5.25% to 5.50%, which is the highest level of interest rates in over 22 years. The decision to hike rates this month was unanimous at the Fed, and it was also signaled that the public can expect to see even further rate hikes up ahead this year. Considering this hike, the investing community continues to be plagued with inflation-related concerns and what the current interest rate levels will mean for businesses and consumers heading into the second half of the year. For many, the jump to such a high level of interest rates is proving to be a source of market uncertainty and turbulence, while others are holding on to the belief that the Fed will manage to bring inflation down to a maximum rate of 2% in the long run, as has been affirmed in the Federal Open Market Committee statement.

In light of this hike, in a CNBC interview on July 26, David Kelly from JPMorgan Asset Management made the following comments on how he views stocks progressing in the market over the next six months and beyond:

""I look at valuations a lot and I do worry about the mega-cap stocks that have really led this charge. But overall I think it good be pretty good because the key point is, eventually inflations gonna get back down to where we were in the last decade, it's gonna get back down to 2%. Eventually, the Fed's gonna have to react to a recession and cut rates back down again and so you get back to a slow growth, low inflation environment in which companies are very good at maintaining margins. I mean that's the other message that we've seen from the earnings reports so far this month. You know, there's a problem with revenues, but they're doing a great job at maintaining margins. I think US companies can do well in a cold climate, and I think the stock market is taking comfort from that.""

Navigating The Market After The Hike

According to Kelly, it is becoming increasingly important to keep an eye on stock valuations heading into the second half of the year to ensure one does not end up with overpriced stocks in the event of a market correction. For him, the choice sectors to keep an eye on include industrials and financials. Overall though, Kelly's opinion seems to be that even in the event of a recession, US companies can be expected to perform well enough to satisfy their shareholders.

Considering the above, it has become abundantly clear that investors today should really consider factors like stock valuations, potential impacts of the recent rate hike, higher prices, and much more when they are making their investments. Another factor that might be worth considering is the performance of companies that are steadily gaining popularity among the younger generations of consumers and investors today. These up-and-coming stocks, such as e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), are now offering products to a new cohort of consumers that are setting them apart from their competitors and increasing consumer engagement. Some may consider them to be some of the best stocks to invest in right now, and many of the names on our list below can be considered to be some of the best growth stocks for the next 10 years even. In light of imminent market uncertainty and recession-related concerns, we have thus compiled the list below to give investors today some more choices that may be beneficial additions to their portfolios.  11 Best Up And Coming Stocks To Invest In

11. Teladoc Health, Inc (NYSE:TDOC)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30

Teladoc Health, Inc (NYSE:TDOC) is a healthcare company based in Purchase, New York. It operates through its Integrated Care and BetterHelp segments. The company is steadily making a name for itself in the healthcare sector with its telehealth services, allowing patients to consult with medical professionals on its videoconferencing platform.

There were 30 hedge funds long Teladoc Health, Inc (NYSE:TDOC) at the end of the first quarter, holding $890.2 million shares in the company.

Like e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), Teladoc Health, Inc (NYSE:TDOC) is a stock that has become increasingly popular among individual investors and hedge funds alike this year.

10. e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30

Olivia Tong, an analyst at Raymond James, maintains an Outperform rating on e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF) as of July 24. The analyst also raised her price target on the shares from $115 to $125.

“New positions initiated in Q4 included shorts International Business Machines (IBM), Acushnet Holdings (GOLF) and E.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF). Shares of value-oriented beauty brand ELF received a meaningful boost from normalizing beauty usage and spending in a post-COVID environment, which we believe has contributed to its premium multiple relative to competitors in the beauty space. As this temporary lift unwinds, we expect elf’s valuation to similarly return to a level better aligned with its product offerings.”

9. Crocs, Inc. (NASDAQ:CROX)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31

Crocs, Inc. (NASDAQ:CROX) was seen in the portfolios of 31 hedge funds during the first quarter, with a total stake value of $1.1 billion.

Crocs, Inc. (NASDAQ:CROX) is a footwear company based in Broomfield, Colorado. It designs and manufactures casual lifestyle footwear and accessories for customers across the globe.

Here's what Artisan Partners had to say about Crocs, Inc. (NASDAQ:CROX) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:

“We began new GardenSM positions in Crocs, Inc. (NASDAQ:CROX), Saia and Shift4 Payments during the quarter. Crocs designs, develops, manufactures and distributes casual footwear and accessories for men, women and children. The company invented the molded plastic Clog in 2002 and has turned it into a $3B global revenue base. We believe revenue growth will continue to surprise to the upside driven by expansion opportunities outside the US, demand from new product introductions (including from recently acquired Hey Dude) and a distribution push both within the direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels. Given the company is still small in terms of a global market share (its $4B in revenues puts them at 1% global market share of the footwear industry), we believe there is a long runway for growth and initiated a GardenSM position.”

This is what Polen Capital said about Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:

“We initiated a position in Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN), a global medical device company best known for its “Invisalign” clear aligners, having created the clear aligner category in 1999. Since that time, it has been a disruptor of the traditional use of wire and bracket braces to straighten teeth and treat malocclusions. While it is leader in the clear aligner category with roughly 85-90% market share, the bigger competition is taking share from wire and brackets and on that measure, it only has 10-15% share of the overall teeth straightening market. Over time, through innovation and vertical integration, the company has evolved to be able to treat over 90% of all cases. Further, it has done a great job deepening relationships with orthodontists and general practitioner dentists over time. All in all, we believe this is a business with a durable competitive advantage, operating in a large, growing and very attractive industry, led by a proven and long-term oriented management team, with a very long runway ahead of it to grow and compound at very attractive rates.”

Of course, you’ll find some research on this topic that implies that celebrated market gurus don’t always get it right. However, it still may be worthwhile to follow stocks backed by analysts.

For starters, not everyone plucked off the streets can be an analyst. Almost always, these folks have studied finance or accounting in college. If they haven’t, they certainly accrued significant real-world experience. Chances are, these experts have learned from handed-down knowledge, which offers confidence for the best Wall Street stocks.

Second, targeting these analyst-endorsed high-confidence stocks enables efficiencies for the retail investor. Quite simply, the average market participant doesn’t have the time to dedicate the hours necessary to conduct deep due diligence. So, by trading with the experts, retail buyers can get some of their time back. On that note, below are the top 7 analysts’ favorite stocks.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Top Analyst Stocks: Becton Dickinson (BDX) A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.

A multinational medical technology firm, Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) – also known as BD – ranks among the top analyst stocks for good reason. By manufacturing and selling medical devices, instrument systems, and reagents, the business will never go out of style. Therefore, it enjoys insulation from various economic pressure points. Since the start of the year, BDX gained almost 11% of its equity value.

Most recently, analysts from Piper Sandler, Stifel Nicolaus, and Raymond James pegged BDX as a buy. Among the three experts, Stifel’s Rick Wise issued the highest price target at $325, which implies nearly 15% upside potential. Overall, the consensus assessment over the past three months stands at moderate buy. Further, the average price target lands at $291.82, implying 3% growth.

Story continues

Again, it’s not the most exciting entity among stocks backed by analysts. However, BD enjoys consistent profitability, thus providing confidence. Also, BDX trades at a forward multiple of 20.79. As a discount to projected earnings, it ranks better than 72% of the competition.

One year can make all the difference in the world as social media and technology juggernaut Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) can attest. Throughout 2022, a troubling combination of economic headwinds (thanks to hawkish monetary policy), digital advertisement market erosion and struggling traction with the metaverse hurt META considerably. However, 2023 represents an entirely new paradigm, with shares up 136% since the Jan. opener.

Most recently, analysts from Mizuho Securities and New Street assigned buy ratings on META stock. Both experts forecasted a price target of $350, implying nearly 19% upside potential. Overall, META carries a strong buy consensus view. This assessment breaks down as 36 buys, three holds and zero sells over the past three months. On average, the experts believe META will hit $326.45, implying nearly 11% growth.

Financially, it’s not difficult to see why the tech giant ranks among the top analyst stocks. Enjoying profitability year in and year out, Meta is also a growth machine. Specifically, its three-year sales expansion rate (per-share basis) clocks in at 20.6%, outpacing 71.48% of its peers.

Zscaler (ZS) tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocks

A cybersecurity firm, Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) specializes in enterprise cloud security services. Fundamentally, Zscaler operates in a high-demand field. While digital connectivity fostered myriad positive innovations, it also sparked nefarious activities. Increasingly, data breaches and other forms of digital compromising events cost companies billions of dollars collectively. So, it’s no shock that ZS represents one of the top analyst stocks.

Speaking of which, BTIG’s Gray Powell assigned ZS stock as a buy. Further, the expert forecasts shares hitting $185, implying over 19% upside potential. Overall, Zscaler carries a strong buy consensus view. This assessment breaks down as 23 buys, seven holds and zero sells. On average, the experts’ price target lands at $172.41, implying over 11% growth.

Financially, ZS presents a bit of a tricky argument. For example, it trades at a forward multiple of 72.52, which is quite rich. At the same time, ZS makes a case for best Wall Street stocks because of its enormous growth, specifically a three-year sales expansion rate of 46.7%.

Anheuser-Busch (BUD) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks

One of the most contentious names among top analyst stocks, brewery Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) landed in hot water recently for a one-off promotion that deeply offended politically conservative buyers of Bud Light, one of Anheuser’s brands. Consistently, Bud Light ranked as America’s top-selling beer, although that’s no longer the case. Obviously, bad PR doesn’t help.

However, BUD may still be one of the high-confidence stocks because eventually, controversies tend to blow over with time. I mean, it wasn’t too long ago that former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick set off a fierce debate in America. Now, people don’t even talk about Kaepernick that much. I’m sure this, too, will pass.

In the meantime, BUD symbolizes one of the top 7 analysts’ favorite stocks. A few days ago, Morgan Stanley’s Sarah Simon initiated coverage of BUD with a buy rating. As well, the expert believes shares will hit $68.50, implying 17% upside potential. Overall, BUD carries a moderate buy consensus view with an average price target of $69.05, implying 18% growth.

Host Hotels & Resorts (HST) A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneath

Moving onto riskier ideas for top analyst stocks, Host Hotels & Resorts (NASDAQ:HST) is structured as a real estate investment trust. As you might imagine from its corporate name, the enterprise invests in hotel properties. So far this year, HST performs okay, with shares gaining nearly 10%. That’s not remarkable considering that the benchmark equities index is almost double the performance.

Still, HST happens to be one of the stocks backed by analysts. On the bullish side, Oppenheimer’s Tyler Batory upgraded HST to a buy. As well, the expert forecasts a $22 price target, implying nearly 26% upside potential. Overall, the consensus view for HST comes in as a moderate buy. The experts’ average price target lands at $20.25, implying almost 16% growth.

Financially, it appears that analysts believe in the narrative of revenge travel more so than the objective data. For example, investment data aggregator Gurufocus warns its readers that HST may be a possible value trap. Still, with shares trading at 8.53X funds from operation (FFO), Host Hotels could be undervalued.

Harley-Davidson (HOG) a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buy

An iconic motorcycle company, Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) riders probably won’t be caught dead with Bud Light at this juncture. Essentially a throwback to a more rugged time in American history, Harley may have some difficulty gaining traction with today’s youth. Still, Harley is evolving, with the icon moving into electric-powered motorcycles with its Livewire brand. From what I understand, these Livewire bikes are a real thrill.

Perhaps that’s why this old HOG still ranks among the top analyst stocks. A few days ago, D.A. Davidson’s Brandon Rolle upgraded shares to a buy. Also, a few days before that, BMO Capital assigned a buy rating with a $57 price target, implying nearly 53% upside potential. Overall, HOG rates as a moderate buy with an average price target of $45.67, implying over 22% growth.

What might appeal to speculators of the best Wall Street stocks is the value proposition. Right now, shares trade at a forward multiple of 7.74. As a discount to projected earnings, Harley-Davidson ranks better than 79.53% of the competition.

Coeur Mining (CDE) image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocks

Fundamentally, the equation for precious metals mining firm Coeur Mining (NYSE:CDE) seems simple. With the Federal Reserve struggling to combat stubbornly high prices, it has a long-term hawkish view. That’s going to tighten the money supply, which in turn will hurt CDE. Perhaps to little surprise, since the Jan. opener, shares stumbled 5%. So, why is Coeur one of the top analyst stocks?

A few days ago, Canaccord Genuity’s Dalton Baretto upgraded CDE to a buy. As well, the expert forecasted a price of $3.75, implying just over 16% upside potential. Overall, Coeur carries a consensus view of moderate buy. On average, the price target stands at $4, implying nearly 24% growth.

Financially, Coeur presents a challenging framework to put it diplomatically. For instance, its Altman Z-Score sits at 1.24 below zero, indicating a distressed business. As well, the company carries too much debt. At the same time, the company is attractively priced against tangible book value. Further, economic uncertainty might spark the fear trade, which could help lift CDE.

2023-07-31T18:00:47+00:00,Jim Cramer’s 10 S&amp;P 500 Stock Picks for 2023,"In this article, we discuss Jim Cramer's 10 S&P 500 stock picks for 2023. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Jim Cramer's 5 S&P 500 Stock Picks for 2023.

The S&P 500 was under immense pressure in 2022, going down by 19.4% as most of its listings crumbled amid the push by the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates. Inflation near record highs meant few investors had the stomach to take up risk in the equity markets, all but fueling the selloff. Recession fears and the Russian-Ukraine war all but accelerated the selloff spree. Amid the bearish sentiments in the market, CNBC's Jim Cramer was overly concerned over whether the market will bounce back amid the steep selloff.

The Federal Reserve embarking on an aggressive monetary tightening spree in the race to clamp down on inflationary pressures that were getting out of hand spelled more trouble, according to Cramer. Amid the interest hiking spree, the CNBC commentator warned of the potential recession risk that could significantly affect investors' sentiments.

The warnings did not come as a surprise as Cramer tends to be bearish on the market and its prospects regardless of the ongoings. While he has been a staple of the financial news industry for decades, Cramer sometimes gets things wrong, which has seen him become the laughingstock of Wall Street. Given that his predictions are often controversial, with a portion of them turning out wrong, some investors often shun them or opt to do the opposite of what he does.

The fact that some of Cramer’s predictions rarely come to fruition has led to the creation of a Twitter account called Inverse Jim Cramer. The account is best known for taking the opposite position on Cramer's financial decisions about the stock market.

Chevron was one of Cramer’s top picks at the start of the year. He insisted it was becoming cheaper and cheaper as it went down. The CNBC Mad Money host reiterated that the stock would be a winner as long as oil prices stayed above the $60-a barrel level. However, that has not been the case, as the stock has already lost more than 9% in market value and remains under pressure.

One prediction that Cramer might want to forget sooner than later is that of Silicon Valley bank parent company SVB Financials. While making the prediction, the CNBC commentator reiterated that it will be one of the biggest winners of 2023 alongside other blue-chip stocks like Tesla and Meta.

“This company is a merchant bank with a deposit base that Wall Street has mistakenly been concerned by,” Cramer said in the clip.

That prediction came to bite as Silicon Valley Bank went under at the height of the banking crisis that I regional banks. Jim Cramer's 10 S&P 500 Stock Picks for 2023

Nevertheless, Cramer is sometimes wrong, and whenever he gets it right, there is always something to smile about. Despite getting it wrong with Chevron and SVB Financials, Cramer also reiterated that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) as some of the best stocks to consider in 2023. True to his predictions, the stocks have lived up to expectations and emerged as key drivers of the overall bull market.

Even though the overall market is trading well above its recent lows, plenty of stocks are trading less than they were a year ago. Some of these stocks boast impressive risk-reward given the tremendous upside potential. As valuation concerns become a big issue after the massive rally year to date, CNBCs Cramer believes there are stocks likely to fair well even on the economy plunging into recession.

Our Methodology

The list of Jim Cramer's 10 S&P 500 stock picks for 2023 takes into considerations stock picks that the CNBC’s commentator predicted will outperform the market in 2023 at the start of the year. He chose five stocks from each of the groups of the highest and lowest performers in the S&P 500 in 2022 that might be winners in 2023.

While some of the stocks have lived up to expectations and rallied significantly others have been a big disappointment. We ranked the stocks based on their gains from when Cramer made his predictions. Overall, an equal weighted portfolio of these 10 stocks returned nearly 25% year-to-date and outperformed the S&P 500 Index.

10. V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC)

Upside Potential: 21.30%

Gain since Cramer Prediction: -29%

Price to earnings multiple: 9

V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) is a big miss in Cramer’s predictions. The CNBC commentator expected the company to bounce back while betting that the new interim CEO Benno Dorer will help reinvigorate the company's fortunes. However that has not been the case as the stock is down by 29% year to date.

V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC)'s growth metrics have mostly been cut short by inflation and other macro headwinds. Intermittent lockdowns in China last year and currency headwinds have also affected its revenue base. Consequently, the stock is down by about 29% year to date.

Consequently, V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) is trading with a price-to-earnings multiple of 9 compared to 26 for the S&P 500. In addition, analysts on Wall Street have a $23.86 price target on the stock implying a 21.30% upside potential.

9. Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH)

Upside Potential: 38.98%

Gain since Cramer Prediction: -23%

Price to earnings multiple: 34

Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) has been a big disappointment as it is down by about 23% year to date. The underperformance comes against the backdrop of Cramer terming the energy company a renewable golden boy at the beginning of the year.

The company designs, develop, manufactures, and sells home energy solution for the solar photovoltaic industry. While it has underperformed the overall market, Cramer believes the company remains well positioned to benefit from the clean energy push in the US.

The company delivered impressive Q2 results with revenues increasing 34.1%  to $711.1 million despite missing estimates of $727 million.  The bottom line increased 37.4% to $1.47 a share beating consensus estimates of $1.27 a share.

The stock trades at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 34 compared to an average of 26 for S&P 500. The average price target on the stock is $240.94, implying a 38.94% upside potential from current levels.

8. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)

Upside Potential: 11.90%

Gain since Cramer Prediction: -13%

Price to earnings multiple: 20

Cramer believes Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is one of the best defense contractors as the Russia-Ukraine war persists. The company operates as an aerospace and defense company providing aircraft systems workwise. It delivered impressive Q1 results with earnings of $5.50 a share against $5.09 a share expected on revenues of $9.3 billion against the $9.2 billion that Wall Street expected.

Early in the year Cramer touted Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE:NOC) as one of the best defense contractors as the Russia-Ukraine war persists. However, that has not been the case as the stock has underperformed going by the 13% decline year to date.

While Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) has been under pressure going down by 13% year to date, it's been under consolidation in recent months. Likewise, it trades at a discount with a price-to-earnings multiple of 20 compared to 26 for the S&P 500. The average price target on the stock is $511.55, repressing an 11.90% upside potential from current levels.

7. Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL)

Upside Potential: 19.08%

Gain since Cramer Prediction: 1.03%

Price to earnings multiple: 12

At the start of the year Cramer predicted Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) will have a multiyear rally. However that has not been the case as it is only up by about 1% year to date compared to an 18% gain for the S&P 500.

Nevertheless, the company's sentiments have improved significantly, going by the 35% rally over the past two months. The rally has come at the back of an uptick in energy prices.

Expectations that oil prices will find support above the $80 a barrel level strengthens the oil field services company's outlook. The provider of products and services for the energy industry is likely to benefit from the booming energy industry by year-end.

Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) already exhibits strong financial metrics with earnings per share of $2.16, operating margin of 16.21%, and return on invested capital of 15.61%. While trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 12, Haliburton boasts of a solid 1.67% dividend yield

Cramer predicts that Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) has a multiyear rally ahead as the average price target is $45.50, implying a 19.08% upside potential from current levels.

6. McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK)

Upside Potential: 11.69%

Gain since Cramer Prediction: 7.4%

Price to earnings multiple: 15

McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) is one stock that Cramer believes will do well even with the economy slowing down amid recession fears. However that has not been the case as the stock has underperformed on the overall market turning bullish. Its 7% gain is an understatement going by the 18% gain for the S&P 500 over the same period.

McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) is already up by about 7% but boasts tremendous upside potential owing to its low valuation and long-term growth potential. Over the past three years, it has delivered over 400% return. It's fresh from increasing its dividend by 15%, affirming its ability to generate strong cash flows.

The stock trades at a discount with a price-to-earnings multiple of 15, backed with a 0.60% dividend yield. With an average price target of $451, McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) has an 11.69% upside potential from current levels.

2023-07-31T16:10:16+00:00,Buy Alert: 3 Solar Stocks Nearing Super Attractive Entry Points,"The International Energy Agency reported that solar will become the largest source of power in the world, surpassing coal, by 2027. Moreover, the agency forecasts that global solar output will more than double by that year, with the energy source’s capacity continually climbing over that time period. The entity explained that utility-scale solar PV is the cheapest option for generating new electricity in most countries around the globe. Finally, rooftop solar will also increase rapidly due to rising electricity bills and government support, the agency stated. Given the expected rapid growth of solar, investors should buy these three top solar stock picks.

First Solar (FSLR)

According to Investor’s Business Daily, U.S.-based solar panel maker First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) has a relative strength rating of 94, showing that it has become a favorite name for many investors over the past year. Yet it has an accumulation/distribution score of B- on IBD’s scale, indicating that institutional investors have not been extremely enthusiastic about FSLR over the last 13 weeks.

But that could change after the company reported stronger-than-expected second-quarter results on July 27. The results featured an increase in its earnings per share to $1.59 from just 40 cents during the company’s first quarter. Additionally, FSLR stated that it would open a new factory in the U.S. in 2026, suggesting its demand outlook in America is very strong.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Investors have generally embraced the shares, but institutional buyers still have reservations. However, the company’s fundamentals are strong and improving. Given these points, FSLR is nearing a super attractive entry point.

The leading developer of solar energy in the U.S., NextEra (NYSE:NEE) has an earnings per share rating of 90 from Investor’s Business Daily, indicating the company is quite profitable.

Story continues

Indeed, analysts — on average — predict its earnings per share will come in at $3.40 in 2024, up from $2.90 in 2022. Also noteworthy is that Investor’s Business Daily gives NEE an accumulation/distribution grade of B. The grade indicates that institutional investors have been warming up to the name over the past 13 weeks.

Further, NEE’s net income jumped nearly 100% last quarter, reaching $2.8 billion, versus $1.38 billion during the same period a year earlier. Amazingly, the net income of the company’s renewable energy unit soared over 10 times versus the same period a year earlier to $1.46 billion.

And in-line with my prior forecasts, Florida Power & Light, the country’s largest electric utility, rapidly expanded during Q2, gaining 66,000 more customers year-over-year (YOY).

As with FSLR, NEE’s strong fundamentals and increasing interest by institutional investors indicate the stock is nearing a super attractive entry point.

SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) the solar edge logo on an iPhone. SEDG stock

Israel-based SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG) specializes in making inverters used to convert solar energy into electricity.

SEDG stock has sunk in recent weeks, falling from $283 .85 at the market close on July 17 to $236.79 at the close on July 28. I believe SEDG’s retreat was primarily caused by worries about higher interest rates, coupled with weaker-than-expected Q2 results reported by its top competitor, Enphase (NASDAQ:ENPH).

However, ENPH reported that its business was booming in Europe, as its sales in the region jumped 25% for the quarter and more than tripled YOY. But Enphase gets nearly 59% of its revenue from the U.S., where demand slowed outside California.

Conversely, SEDG generated 47% of its sales a year ago from Europe, leaving it significantly better positioned than ENPH. Many investors may not realize the distinction, but they likely will after the company reports its Q2 results on August 1.

Finally, in the wake of the stock’s recent retreat, its forward price-earnings ratio is an attractive 24.3.

2023-07-30T12:03:00+00:00,Sirius XM Holdings' (NASDAQ:SIRI) Dividend Will Be $0.0242,"Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:SIRI) will pay a dividend of $0.0242 on the 30th of August. Including this payment, the dividend yield on the stock will be 1.9%, which is a modest boost for shareholders' returns.

While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Investors will be pleased to see that Sirius XM Holdings' stock price has increased by 35% in the last 3 months, which is good for shareholders and can also explain a decrease in the dividend yield.

See our latest analysis for Sirius XM Holdings

Sirius XM Holdings' Payment Has Solid Earnings Coverage

While yield is important, another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. However, prior to this announcement, Sirius XM Holdings' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.

Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 28.0%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 30% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range. historic-dividend

Sirius XM Holdings Is Still Building Its Track Record

The dividend's track record has been pretty solid, but with only 7 years of history we want to see a few more years of history before making any solid conclusions. Since 2016, the annual payment back then was $0.04, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.0968. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 13% per annum over that time. It is always nice to see strong dividend growth, but with such a short payment history we wouldn't be inclined to rely on it until a longer track record can be developed.

The Dividend Looks Likely To Grow

Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. We are encouraged to see that Sirius XM Holdings has grown earnings per share at 13% per year over the past five years. Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend, as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting.

Sirius XM Holdings Looks Like A Great Dividend Stock

Overall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.

Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For example, we've identified 4 warning signs for Sirius XM Holdings (2 are a bit concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

We have also covered some interesting insights on remote work for these jobs and companies that have recently increased their hourly wages. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 5 Fastest-Growing Blue-Collar Jobs.

Remote Work for Blue Collar Jobs

We know that the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the trend of remote work. However, it was not just for white-collar professionals but also for lower-paid service workers, including blue-collar employees in different industries. Remote work for blue-collar workers like desk receptionists was largely facilitated by programs like Zoom Video Communications, Inc (NASDAQ:ZM)’s video conferring, which allowed them to connect with customers across states and even across the country and provided a sense of being in the same room.

The ability to work remotely has significantly impacted the labor force participation rate, which increased from 62.2% to 62.6% in June 2023, with more workers seeking remote roles. About 20% of active job seekers are now looking exclusively for remote work. The option to work from home has particularly benefited women aged 25 to 54, with their participation rate reaching a record 77.8%.

Blue-collar industries, such as restaurants and retail, have also embraced remote work as a solution to severe labor shortages. For instance, the restaurant chain Baby Jack's implemented remote drive-thru workers and saw a surge in job applications. In addition, Bite Ninja, a sister company that employs remote gig workers and serves multiple fast-food chains across several states, provides new job opportunities for stay-at-home mothers, the disabled, and college students.

What are the Highest-Paying Blue-Collar Jobs?

Power plant operators, aircraft technicians, and petroleum pump system operators are a few of the highest-paying blue-collar jobs. However, if we are speaking numbers here, Air Traffic Controller is one of the high-paying blue-collar jobs with a six-figure salary. Moreover, one of the best blue-collar jobs is an Electrician. This is because the role offers job stability and steady demand as electrical systems are integral to modern life.

Story continues

Electricians have opportunities for career advancement and can earn competitive wages with relatively short training periods. However, with the current job market in the US, blue-collar workers have been demanding higher wages for their survival in the face of rising inflation. To address the issue, some companies have proven to provide relief to these workers by increasing minimum hourly wages. Speaking of minimum wages, you should also check out our article on countries with the highest minimum wage in the world.

Companies Providing Relief to the Blue-Collar Jobs

In 2022, Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) announced plans to increase its team members' pay and benefits, investing up to $300 million more in the year 2023. They set a new starting wage range from $15 to $24 per hour for Target Corp (NYSE:TGT)’s hourly team members and expanded access to health care benefits. About 20% of the team was made to be eligible for comprehensive health care, and enrollment waiting periods were reduced, providing faster access to coverage. Target Corp (NYSE:TGT)’s investments build upon its efforts to create rewarding careers, including debt-free education assistance, mental health support, and family-focused benefits.

Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) is one of the US’s biggest private employers with about 475,000 workers. Majority of its employees are hourly workers at its approximately 2,300 stores in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD), despite forecasting flat sales and lower profits for 2023, implemented a $1 billion pay hike for its frontline workers. This strategic move was aimed at maintaining Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD)’s industry-leading position and attracting high-quality workers.

Recently, Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) announced to invest over $700 million to increase their hourly wages for their frontline workers. Over the past several years, Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) has also made remarkable investments in its frontline retail staff, with an allocation of $1.9 billion towards benefits and salaries since 2018. They raised their average hourly rate to $18 or $23.50 per hour with benefits four years ago. Moreover, Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) has also offered an educational program providing up to $21,000 for continuing education opportunities, free financial coaching, and access to counseling services.

Is AI threatening Blue Collar Jobs?

Despite some promising blue collar jobs, there are concerns that the rapid growth of AI, exemplified by language models like ChatGPT, poses both opportunities and challenges for the blue-collar job market as automation may lead to the displacement of 85 million jobs in the next 2 years.

AI chatbots and virtual assistants can decrease the demand for manual labor in industries like manufacturing and customer service. Between 400 million and 800 million individuals worldwide may face unemployment due to automation by 2030.

2023-07-27T17:49:42+00:00,3 Sleeper Growth Stocks Set to Deliver Explosive Returns in 2023,"Many growth stocks that haven’t aligned with Wall Street’s AI fascination this year have been left out of this “bull market,” even with excellent fundamentals. Once smart money starts scanning the market deeper, many such sleeper growth stocks will start a breakout to the upside. Thus, getting in while they are still in the sleeper phase is a great idea.

I would also like to note that sleeper growth stocks usually have substantial upside potential as many of their positive characteristics are not yet priced in by the market. Even better, they also provide a great margin of safety as they trade below their intrinsic value.

We’ll be talking about the following three sleeper growth stocks:

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

JD.com (JD) the JD.com (JD) logo on the outside of a building

Source: testing / Shutterstock.com

JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is a Chinese e-commerce company with over 580 million active customers. It is China’s biggest e-commerce company in terms of sales, even bigger than Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). Both businesses are very similar; their growth stories and stock prices reflect that. However, what is different regarding JD.com is that the company seems much more secure from the CCP’s crackdown. The same can’t be said about Alibaba, which Chinese authorities have constantly scrutinized.

JD stock reached a peak in early 2021 and has been on the slide since. But recent price action has turned positive, and the momentum implies that a strong U-turn is underway. The company is definitely trading below its intrinsic value, which Gurufocus considers to be at $92. I agree with that price since JD trades at forward earnings multiple of 12.7 times despite nearly double-digit sales growth projections for the next two years.

Even Wall Street seems very optimistic here. The consensus analyst price target is at $61, implying a 55% upside potential.

Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) The logo of the new Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) company on smartphone screen.

Source: Jimmy Tudeschi / Shutterstock.com

Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) is another company sitting at quite a depressed level. It is up 33.8% year-to-date, but it’s still nearly 50% below what this merger previously traded at more than a year ago. This decline is not without its reasons, of course. Warner Bros Discovery has a profitability problem, and 12-month losses sit at a staggering $8.9 billion. Based on the quarterly data, these losses have been trimmed from $3.4 billion in Q2 2022 to $1.1 billion in Q1 2023. Quite the improvement.

Story continues

However, this expenditure also has some good side effects too. Warner Bros has been clearing its debt, and analysts have optimistic projections further down the line. The future 3-5Y revenue growth rate sits at 10.7%, better than 77% of its media peers. But again, bottom-line misses are likely due to Warner Bros Discovery’s aggressive spending on content. It plans to spend $9.5 billion on original content this year.

Regardless, I don’t see Warner Bros Discovery in a cash crunch, and earnings disappointments have mostly been digested. It can also divert some from its massive debt repayment program if it ever needs cash. The stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of 17.8 times. Wall Street analysts recognize that the discount and the average analyst price target imply a 69% upside potential here.

Zoom (ZM) A woman sitting at a desk waves at a large number of people on the videoconferencing software Zoom (ZM).

Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) was well awake during the pandemic era, and the stock traded at nearly $560 in Oct. 2020. However, the pandemic is sliding into distant memory for most people, and so is anything strongly associated with it. Zoom also “came and went,” for most people.

However, that is not entirely true. Not everyone is using Zoom, but there is massive potential here. The stock now trades 30% below even its pre-pandemic peak as Wall Street is busy with more trendy things. But this is a long-term play, and holding it with patience will likely return hefty gains. That’s because the work-from-home trend is still alive. The pandemic did give it a short-term boost followed by a decline, but it is still gaining traction in the very long run. Zoom will be a clear winner from this trend as it is now the first thing that comes to people’s minds regarding video conferencing. The pandemic left this company with a powerful brand and $5.6 billion in cash with meager debt, yet it continues trading at more or less the same level as before the pandemic.

Accordingly, Gurufocus has a very optimistic fair price target of $250 by 2026.

2023-07-30T11:01:07+00:00,"Is JD.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:JD) Recent Stock Performance Influenced By Its Fundamentals In Any Way?","JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 19% over the last month. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. In this article, we decided to focus on JD.com's  ROE.

Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.

Check out our latest analysis for JD.com

How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?

Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for JD.com is:

7.1% = CN¥19b ÷ CN¥274b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).

The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.07 in profit.

Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?

Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.

A Side By Side comparison of JD.com's Earnings Growth And 7.1% ROE

When you first look at it, JD.com's ROE doesn't look that attractive. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 17%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. JD.com was still able to see a decent net income growth of 15% over the past five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.

Story continues

As a next step, we compared JD.com's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 15% in the same period. past-earnings-growth

Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is JD worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether JD is currently mispriced by the market.

Is JD.com Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?

While JD.com has a three-year median payout ratio of 64% (which means it retains 36% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.

Summary

Overall, we feel that JD.com certainly does have some positive factors to consider. While no doubt its earnings growth is pretty substantial, we do feel that the reinvestment rate is pretty low, meaning, the earnings growth number could have been significantly higher had the company been retaining more of its profits. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate.

2023-07-28T17:00:55+00:00,11 Best Logistics Stocks to Buy,"In this article, we discuss the 11 best logistics stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the logistics industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Logistics Stocks to Buy.

According to Precedence Research, the size of the logistics industry stood at $10.68 trillion at the end of 2022. The industry is set to experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.48% to reach a size of $18.23 trillion by 2032. Meanwhile, London, UK-based professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) estimates that the logistics industry generates an estimated annual revenue of $4.6 trillion. Presently, the North American region dominates the logistics industry. The logistics industry can be broadly categorized into three notable groups based on their business models. A first-party logistics (1PL) provider is a basic form of logistics management where a company or organization handles its own logistics operations internally. A second-party logistics (2PL) provider comes into play when a company engages in a direct logistics partnership with another company. Meanwhile, a third-party logistics (3PL) provider is a dedicated entity that handles the transportation, inventory management, warehousing, and other services for any company.

One of the main drivers in the growth of the global logistics industry is the boom in the e-commerce industry. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the contribution of e-commerce sales as part of total retail sales from 16% to 19% in 2020. Leading e-commerce companies like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), and PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) experienced their top-line increase by 70% between 2019 and 2021 and the total share of these prominent e-commerce platforms as a percentage of total global e-commerce sales increased from 75% in 2019 to 80% in 2021.  Such dynamic growth in the e-commerce industry has resulted in some of the biggest global logistics and shipping companies expanding their operations and investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), automated warehouses, the Internet of Things (IoT), predictive analysis, and real-time tracking.

Story continues

The logistics industry is anticipated to experience tailwinds as road connectivity in developing countries is now improving. This improvement in road connectivity is expected to offer greater upside potential to the best transportation stocks, such as CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX), FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), and Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP). One notable measure intended to give a boost to the industry is the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), also known as the New Silk Road, launched by China in 2013. The initiative includes a wide network of highways and railroads expanding into former Soviet countries in the West. Meanwhile, in the South, China intends to expand this network through its neighboring countries, Pakistan and India. China has been able to reach agreements with 147 countries of the world that are responsible for contributing two-thirds of the global gross domestic product (GDP). The biggest component of the BRI is the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), with an estimated cost of $62 billion. To date, China has spent over $1 trillion on the BRI, with experts believing that the total outlay could reach $8 trillion by the time of completion. Investors seeking opportunities in the logistics sector are considering investing in trucking stocks with dividends and freight stocks. 11 Best Logistics Stocks to Buy

In a research note issued on June 30, Christian Wetherbee at Citigroup increased the price target on ArcBest Corporation (NASDAQ:ARCB) from $110 to $118 and reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. The possibility of Yellow Corporation (NASDAQ:YELL) heading towards bankruptcy or a restructuring with a smaller fleet is expected to be a positive development for LTL transportation providers like ArcBest Corporation (NASDAQ:ARCB). The company pays a quarterly dividend of 12 cents per share to its shareholders.

9. XPO, Inc. (NYSE:XPO)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30

Dollar Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $936,903,000

XPO, Inc. (NYSE:XPO) is a Greenwich, Connecticut-based transportation and logistics company that offers a wide range of services. The company is also anticipated to be a beneficiary of a possible bankruptcy or restructuring of Yellow Corporation due to its significant presence in the LTL transportation services segment across North America. Ken Hoexter at Bank of America upgraded XPO, Inc. (NYSE:XPO) stock from a Neutral to a Buy rating on June 28 and increased the target price from $57 to $65.

Here's what Alger Capital said about XPO, Inc. (NYSE:XPO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:

“XPO, Inc. (NYSE:XPO) is the fourth largest less-than-truckload (LTL) service provider in North America. Following its late October spin-off of RXO, Inc., which provides freight brokerage services and last mile logistics, XPO has become a solid pureplay LTL company. During the period, shares of XPO outperformed after the RXO spin-off transaction was consummated in late October and helped unlock the sum of parts value as the market was undervaluing both assets. Moreover, shares of most LTL companies rallied from October to mid-November as part of a broader rally in cyclical stocks.”

8. Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31

Dollar Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $254,163,000

Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD) is a Seattle, Washington-based Fortune 500 logistics and freight forwarding company with a presence in more than 100 countries globally.

According to Insider Monkey’s proprietary hedge fund database, Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management is the biggest hedge fund holder of the shipping logistics stock, with around 2.75 million shares as of Q1 2023. It must be noted that four of the top five hedge fund holders of Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD) during Q1 2023 either increased their holding or initiated a new position in the stock.

7. J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:JBHT)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33

Dollar Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $786,246,000

J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:JBHT) is a Lowell, Arkansas-based logistics and truckload transportation services provider that came into being in 1961.

In a note issued to investors on June 30, an analyst at Citi increased the price target on J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:JBHT) from $200 to $207 and reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. The analyst anticipates modestly improving trends for the trucking industry during the second half of this year. There is a widespread belief that the truckload-levered transporters will see a bottom in Q2 2023.

Wedgewood Partners shared its stance on J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:JBHT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:

“As we continue to familiarize our clients with our SMID portfolio’s holdings, we would like to discuss our significant exposure to the U.S. Transportation industry. We currently have three transportation holdings and have been substantially overweight the industry in comparison to the Russell 2500 index for several years. While these undoubtedly are cyclical business models, we see many long-term tailwinds for the domestic Transportation industry, which will provide attractive growth levels and will allow these companies to improve their returns on investment over time.

J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:JBHT) is the country’s largest independent provider of intermodal transportation services, with smaller businesses in trucking and logistics. Intermodal transportation refers to freight deliveries that require the use of more than one “mode” of transportation, most often including some combination of ocean, railroad, and truck between source and destination. J.B. Hunt generally provides the rail portion of these intermodal loads.

J.B. Hunt benefited from the exacerbated shortage in Truckload capacity in both their intermodal business—where they could directly substitute railroad service for people who weren’t able to find TL capacity—and in their smaller, but rapidly growing Dedicated TL division, where the company takes over all or a portion of a shipping customer’s trucking fleet. While customers were paying significantly higher prices and still struggling to find any trucking capacity, they found it very attractive to contract for a dedicated, outsourced fleet with J.B. Hunt.”

6. Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37

Dollar Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $571,041,000

Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL) is a Thomasville, North Carolina-based LTL freight service provider that was established in 1934. The company has the distinction of having 12 billionaires amongst its shareholders, with an estimated combined holding value of $311.9 million. On June 28, Ken Hoexter at Bank of America also upgraded Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL) stock from a Neutral to a Buy rating and increased the target price from $331 to $391.

Here's what The London Company said about Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:

“Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL) – ODFL outperformed during Q1, reflecting strong operating performance in a negative freight market. ODFL has a relentless focus on service and quality, which resonates with customers in good times and bad. Management’s focus on cost containment this quarter resulted in record levels of profitability, and the company continues to execute on its long-term growth plan. ODFL is widely held as one of the best franchises in transportation.”

In addition to Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL), companies such as CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX), FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), and Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) are also amongst the best logistics stocks to buy.

2023-07-27T17:49:42+00:00,3 Sleeper Growth Stocks Set to Deliver Explosive Returns in 2023,"Many growth stocks that haven’t aligned with Wall Street’s AI fascination this year have been left out of this “bull market,” even with excellent fundamentals. Once smart money starts scanning the market deeper, many such sleeper growth stocks will start a breakout to the upside. Thus, getting in while they are still in the sleeper phase is a great idea.

I would also like to note that sleeper growth stocks usually have substantial upside potential as many of their positive characteristics are not yet priced in by the market. Even better, they also provide a great margin of safety as they trade below their intrinsic value.

We’ll be talking about the following three sleeper growth stocks:

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

JD.com (JD) the JD.com (JD) logo on the outside of a building

Source: testing / Shutterstock.com

JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is a Chinese e-commerce company with over 580 million active customers. It is China’s biggest e-commerce company in terms of sales, even bigger than Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). Both businesses are very similar; their growth stories and stock prices reflect that. However, what is different regarding JD.com is that the company seems much more secure from the CCP’s crackdown. The same can’t be said about Alibaba, which Chinese authorities have constantly scrutinized.

JD stock reached a peak in early 2021 and has been on the slide since. But recent price action has turned positive, and the momentum implies that a strong U-turn is underway. The company is definitely trading below its intrinsic value, which Gurufocus considers to be at $92. I agree with that price since JD trades at forward earnings multiple of 12.7 times despite nearly double-digit sales growth projections for the next two years.

Even Wall Street seems very optimistic here. The consensus analyst price target is at $61, implying a 55% upside potential.

Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) The logo of the new Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) company on smartphone screen.

Source: Jimmy Tudeschi / Shutterstock.com

Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) is another company sitting at quite a depressed level. It is up 33.8% year-to-date, but it’s still nearly 50% below what this merger previously traded at more than a year ago. This decline is not without its reasons, of course. Warner Bros Discovery has a profitability problem, and 12-month losses sit at a staggering $8.9 billion. Based on the quarterly data, these losses have been trimmed from $3.4 billion in Q2 2022 to $1.1 billion in Q1 2023. Quite the improvement.

Story continues

However, this expenditure also has some good side effects too. Warner Bros has been clearing its debt, and analysts have optimistic projections further down the line. The future 3-5Y revenue growth rate sits at 10.7%, better than 77% of its media peers. But again, bottom-line misses are likely due to Warner Bros Discovery’s aggressive spending on content. It plans to spend $9.5 billion on original content this year.

Regardless, I don’t see Warner Bros Discovery in a cash crunch, and earnings disappointments have mostly been digested. It can also divert some from its massive debt repayment program if it ever needs cash. The stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of 17.8 times. Wall Street analysts recognize that the discount and the average analyst price target imply a 69% upside potential here.

Zoom (ZM) A woman sitting at a desk waves at a large number of people on the videoconferencing software Zoom (ZM).

Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) was well awake during the pandemic era, and the stock traded at nearly $560 in Oct. 2020. However, the pandemic is sliding into distant memory for most people, and so is anything strongly associated with it. Zoom also “came and went,” for most people.

However, that is not entirely true. Not everyone is using Zoom, but there is massive potential here. The stock now trades 30% below even its pre-pandemic peak as Wall Street is busy with more trendy things. But this is a long-term play, and holding it with patience will likely return hefty gains. That’s because the work-from-home trend is still alive. The pandemic did give it a short-term boost followed by a decline, but it is still gaining traction in the very long run. Zoom will be a clear winner from this trend as it is now the first thing that comes to people’s minds regarding video conferencing. The pandemic left this company with a powerful brand and $5.6 billion in cash with meager debt, yet it continues trading at more or less the same level as before the pandemic.

Accordingly, Gurufocus has a very optimistic fair price target of $250 by 2026.

It’s also possible to find some undervalued consumer stocks when the market takes a turn lower because some consumer segments are less resistant to recessions – particularly those stocks that deal with consumer staples and must-have purchases people make daily.

This could include companies that sell cleaning products, food, or over-the-counter medications.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

On the other side of the coin are consumer discretionary stocks, which represent products people enjoy having but don’t need to function in their day-to-day lives. This could include entertainment products or vehicles.

Today’s market isn’t tough to define. While some analysts predict a recession in the future, inflation is beginning to drop and consumer spending remains somewhat elevated.

But that doesn’t mean that every consumer stock is a good purchase. In fact, there are plenty of duds out there that you should avoid if you want to get profitable returns. Here are seven that the Portfolio Grader suggests are a bad buy now.

Lucid Group (LCID) Closeup of the Lucid logo seen at a Lucid showroom in Millbrae, California. LCID stock.

Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) is an electric vehicle manufacturer that hasn’t met expectations. When it debuted, the company had high hopes for its first vehicle, the Lucid Air, named MotorTrend’s Car of the Year.

With that kind of beginning, you’d think the company would be in excellent shape. But that’s not the case. Growth and scale are problems. The company produced only 2,173 cars in the year’s second quarter, but that was a drop of nearly 200 vehicles from the previous quarter.

The stock price is down 24% since February and more than 80% since hitting its all-time high in early 2022. It didn’t help when Lucid announced a public offering of more than 173 million shares, which seriously diluted the value of existing shares.

Story continues

Lucid announced a $232 million deal with automaker Aston Martin (OTCMKTS:ARGGY) to supply Aston Martin EV power train and battery systems. But I don’t expect that deal to have a long-term benefit.

LCID stock has a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.

GameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) sign on side of building in blue early morning light

I can’t take an investment in GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock seriously. GameStop is the classic meme stock. In fact, it’s the stock that brought about the meme stock craze as Reddit investors got excited about playing the stock market in 2020.

Sure, some people made some money with the short squeeze, but many more lost. And while the influx of cash during the squeeze elevated GameStop’s stock price and allowed it to get on better financial footing, the growth story of this brick-and-mortar computer gaming retailer hasn’t improved.

Before the short squeeze, GameStop was a penny stock, trading at less than $4. Today it’s just over $20, which is an improvement.

The stock price is highly volatile based on the whims of Reddit retail investors, but you can’t seriously expect this one to go “to the moon” despite what your “diamond hands” are telling you.

GameStop has a market cap of about $7 billion now, but its valuation doesn’t measure up, so I don’t think the stock price or the market capitalization is sustainable.

While GME has some money set aside to potentially acquire to try to change the company, I don’t see the long-term picture changing. GME stock has a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.

AMC Entertainment (AMC) In this photo illustration the AMC Entertainment Holdings logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen. APE stock

Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com

AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) went along with GameStop as a meme stock favorite. The movie theater chain saw its stock run from less than $3 to more than $55.

AMC is plagued by the facts of life in the 21st century. People are more inclined to watch a movie at home via a streaming service than to go to a theater and pay $50 for a seat, popcorn and drinks for a similar experience. Most movies don’t open on a streaming service, but you can afford to wait if you’re patient.

AMC is betting that people will be eager to go to the theater – and to its credit, both Barbie and Oppenheimer opened to huge crowds and glowing reviews. But are there enough “Barbienheimer” weekends to sustain a movie theater chain? I don’t think so.

And that’s even before you consider the Hollywood strikes that will slow down movie production. AMC is already waving sounding alarms, with AMC CEO Adam Aron warning investors that AMC could run out of cash in 2024 or 2025 if it can’t raise equity capital.

Analysts expect AMC to generate nearly $500 million in losses this year on $4.5 billion in revenue. It’s spending $450 million just on interest payments on its debt. Further, AMC has $98 million in bonds expiring in 2025 and $1.5 billion due in 2026.

AMC stock gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.

Mullen Automotive (MULN) In this photo illustration, the Mullen Technologies (MULN) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen

Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com

Of all the sorry consumer stocks on this list, I can say that Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ:MULN) is the worst. And that’s saying something because the Portfolio Grader identified some bad consumer plays.

Mullen is an EV company aiming to make its mark with a lineup that includes a crossover, a sports car, a pickup truck and commercial vehicles. But it’s much more likely to go bankrupt before fulfilling its lofty expectations.

The stock is priced at only 13 cents – and that’s after a massive surge in early July when it announced a $25 million stock buyback program. Mullen also ended its Mullen Advanced Energy Operations agreement, which means Mullen lost access to energy management module technology needed to increase the range of EVs.

Mullen announced a nationwide tour to raise awareness for its EV fleet. I wouldn’t make time on my calendar for it. MULN stock is down more than 95% this year and has an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.

Plug Power (PLUG) Person holding cellphone with logo of American hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc on screen in front of web page Focus on phone display

Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) is in the hydrogen fuel cell business. Its products replace conventional batteries in equipment and vehicles. The company is the largest buyer of liquid hydrogen in the U.S. and has deployed more than 60,000 fuel cell systems.

However, it’s not making money. Plug Power had an operating loss of $658 million last year, with revenues of only $701 million. It was the same old story in Q1 when Plug had $210.29 million in revenue and a net loss of $206.56 million.

It’s no wonder that PLUG stock is down 24% since February and 55% in the last two years.

Maybe people hope that the White House’s push for green energy solutions will be the path forward for Plug Power, but as long as the net margins are as bad as this, I’ll be staying away. PLUG stock has a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.

XPeng (XPEV) The Logo of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng (Guangzhou Xiaopeng Motors, also known as XMotors.ai) on tablet. XPEV Stock

I like an underdog story as much as anyone, and Chinese EV stock XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) is trying to do Rocky Balboa and get up from the mat to go another round.

Share of XPEV stock are up 26% on July 26, after the company announced a partnership with Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY).

The deal calls for the German automaker to partner with XPeng to make two Volkswagen-branded EVs to sell in the Chinese market. Volkswagen is also taking a 5% stake in XPeng.

This sounds like a great deal for Volkswagen to enter the Chinese market. The benefits for XPeng, aside from the $700 million, aren’t as solid, but investors are buying up the stock.

XPEV delivered 8,620 EVs in June, up 15% from the previous month. And it’s starting deliveries on his G6 coupe SUV that launched June 29.

A lot is happening with XPEV stock, and the company’s rating may improve in light of the Volkswagen deal, particularly if it can continue to accelerate its production velocity. But it still has a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.

AT&T (T) AT&T logo on wooden background

Ordinarily, I’d be all over a big dividend. Dividends are essential for income investors to supplement their retirement incomes or reinvest into their portfolios to increase their overall positions.

But AT&T (NYSE:T) is damaged goods in my eyes. Yes, it has a yield of 7.5% now. But investors can’t forget that the company cut its dividend in half just two years ago because times got tough for the telecommunications company.

That happened when AT&T spun off its cable TV and streaming and film segments.

The second quarter was a good one for the company (and for investors). AT&T had embarked on a cost-cutting campaign and said it achieved its goal to slice $6 billion a full year before expected. It hopes to trim another $2 billion over the next three years.

The cost-cutting helped T improve its free cash flow, which came in at $4.2 billion in free cash flow, or about $600 million more than analysts expected. Hopefully, that will persuade T not to cut the dividend again. The company has net debt of $132 billion, so the need to trim costs isn’t going away.

Despite AT&T’s solid second quarter, I’m still suspicious of this company. T gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.
